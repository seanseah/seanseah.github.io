If you couldn't tell by now, I like gadgets. Here's a collection of things I owned, reviewed and meddled with. I have been building computers ever since my Ivan helped me up with my first set, and have also helped friends and family with DIY-ing computers too. Most things i own are generally budget friendly and as much as I like tech, I am not too keen on splurging a fortune on them.

## Gadgets I reviewed

I started GadgetReactor in 2012 together with Zhaolin to start sharing tech news and my own experiences toying with gadgets I bought. I was impressed by the Barnes & Noble Nook Color and wanted to share my experience with it. We didn't had much gadgets and we focused on sharing tech news at the start.

Clan ngE - started with my school mate. There were only four of us, my school mate's brother and a rookie who was an endearing 12 year old - Psymasta. We were really a social group and when I started playing more competitively, we disbanded and I joined one of the big clans in Singapore.

I became known as Kaer[X3M] - and since I was still on 56k dial up connection, my ping connection was usually in the range of 150-250, which was substantial lag for a fast-paced first person shooter. Yet, I handled myself pretty well online and was known as one of the better 56k players. It was also around that time when I took part in my first gaming competition. UnrealTournament was quite big in Singapore, albeit perhaps smaller than Quake but it was still a nice, sizeable community. There were about 30 teams, and we made it to the last 8, before being eliminated.

When I finally made the upgrade over to broadband, that saw a marked improvement in my gameplay. I continued to participate in the clan and I think the best result was in the SAFRA gaming competition as well as one organised at Cathay Cineleisure.
