If you couldn't tell by now, I like gadgets. Here's a collection of things I owned, reviewed and meddled with. 
I have been building computers ever since my Ivan helped me up with my first set, and have also helped friends 
and family with DIY-ing computers too. Most things i own are generally budget friendly and as much as I like tech,
I am not too keen on splurging a fortune on them.

Recent years have seen a significant adoption of Android / Google related gadgets. My other family members have used Apple and also Microsoft based mobile devices so that has kept me abreast of the scene.


My first ever computer was a gift from my father, when I was 12 years old. Before that, I didn't have my computer but had been using them at my cousins and over at friends place. I was a big fan of computer games at that time. Mashing away on a keyboard was pretty entertaining. I especially like [Paperboy](https://archive.org/stream/arcade_paperboy/paperboy.zip?module=paperboy&scale=1&keyboard=arcade) and the Duke Nukem series. 

That first PC was a Pentium 100, with 8mb of RAM. Games were limited but it was great fun. I had no idea why but I kept playing Wing Commander, I guess it was one of those free games. 

## Gadgets I reviewed

I started [GadgetReactor](http://www.gadgetreactor.com) in 2012 together with Zhaolin to share tech news and my own experiences toying with gadgets I bought. I was impressed by the Barnes & Noble Nook Color and wanted to share my experience with it. We didn't had much gadgets and we focused on sharing tech news at the start.

Clan ngE - It was started by my secondary school friend as we were the only two in the school playing Unreal 
Tournament. There were only four of us, my school mate's brother and a rookie who was an endearing 12 year old - 
Psymasta. We were a small social group and when I started playing more competitively, we disbanded and I joined 
one of the bigger clans in Singapore. Now I was known online as Kaer[X3M] - and since I was still on 56k dial up 
connection, my ping connection was usually in the range of 150-250, which was still substantial lag for a 
fast-paced first person shooter. Yet, I handled myself pretty well online and was known as one of the better 
56k players. It was also around that time when I took part in my first gaming competition. Adapting to gameplay 
without lag was a strange experience. UnrealTournament was quite big in Singapore, albeit perhaps smaller than 
Quake but it was still a nice, sizeable community. There were about 30 teams, and we made it to the last 8, before 
being eliminated.

When I finally made the upgrade over to broadband, I saw a marked improvement in my gameplay. Over time, my skills 
improved and I continued to participate in the clan activities although it coincided with my 'O' levels. I still 
remember playing UT on the night before my O level exams. Once the exams were out of the way, there were a couple 
of LAN gmaing competitions and I think the best result was in the SAFRA gaming competition as well as one organised 
at Cathay Cineleisure.
