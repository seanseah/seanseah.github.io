*to know the time to meet at mushroom..* 
*to tell when its time for tea break..* 
*to zao before the school sergeant major comes around to scold us..* 
to help ensure that i will be early when 
meeting jiali.. 

*a watch to do all that and more =)* 
 

Thanks for getting me a watch to help keep track of time.. and of course, 
looking at it definitely will remind me of you! (Not like I ever needed 
something to remind me, haha) It's my birthday present, that's cool and most 
importantly, looks great on me! Been using it very often in office nowadays, 
always waiting for time to pass as hours drag by slowly, but to be honest, 
these few days its getting much better and definitely less of a drag now. 
Guess as time pass, we get used to it, the normal daily routine and accustomed 
to life as such. Hmm.. is that a bad thing?
