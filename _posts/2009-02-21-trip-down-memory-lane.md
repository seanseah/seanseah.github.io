I managed to dug up some of my 
old photos while doing all the Chinese New Year spring cleaning, and part of 
my plan of getting a all in one printer/scanner was to archive some of my old 
photos which I have not got around doing.Speaking 
of which, this year's Chinese New Year was a pretty quiet affair, which was a 
good thing, though lonely. Grandma and most of the family had gone for a 
cruise and she had done a good job informing the usual visitors that nobody 
will be in. Had some time to just rest at home without the usual throngs of 
visitors. But Chinese New Year is a long affair of 15 days and in the end, had 
to make up for the visiting at the last week. Oh well... 
  

Ok enough digressing and back 
to the photos. Surprisingly the older secondary school photos stayed in pretty 
good condition while those army photos quality actually deteriorated quite a 
fair bit. Hmm.. some shoddy work there. Anyway, some good memories there in 
the last few years, especially with all the friends made.
