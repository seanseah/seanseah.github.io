Time flies. February 2019 sees us celebrating Chinese New Year, taking time off 
to visit relatives and friends. As we grow older, the significance and importance
of such ties grow. Without family, we will not be who we are today. 

2018 went by in a relatively short time. It was a good year. There were many things
to be thankful for and I am hoping that 2019 would continue in the same vein.

Arrival of Baby G late last year signified a new beginning. And whatever we thought we knew, or thought 
that we were experts when it comes to bringing up kids, well, it all change 
now that there are two!

Seriously, having two kids is tough. I can't even imagine how people can survive with 3 
kids or more.
