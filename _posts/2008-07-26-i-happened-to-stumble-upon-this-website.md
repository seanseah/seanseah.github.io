I happened to 
stumble upon this website, mapmyrun.com or its parent site, mapmyfitness.com 
which well, basically helps those who wants to monitor their exercise program 
in a more structured way of doing so. Pretty user friendly and erm.. well it 
doesn't force me to exercise, at least knowing the rough distance I am 
covering might help spur me on to train more. Hence, I plotted the usual running route I take around my estate 
to determine how far I normally cover and the shorter route is only around 
2km, sheesh.. not even that of an IPPT run. Anyway, I shall use the site 
more.. since its pretty interesting and I can see it becoming more than just a 
distance estimator / route planner and could be useful for other 
applications... 

So with that I mapped out my 
cycling route, as needed to go Parkway to run some errands. Distance 6km? 
Hmm... calories burnt?
