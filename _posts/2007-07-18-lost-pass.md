Lost my pass today! Ah, only realised it 
when I was at Gabriel's place and immediately thought that I dropped it when I 
got off Eugene's car as I happened to knock against the door. No luck in 
finding the pass in the car and we ended up backtracking my steps all the way 
back to the Eunos bus stop but also couldn't find it. Gone means gone... 

Penalty: 50 dollars fine and disciplinary 
action. 
Whew.. guess they can't do much against me 
now, if I'm on course then its a different story, so ermm.. silver lining 
there. 

Just very sian that the pass dropped off! 
Hmm, guess really should be more careful with it next time and to remember to 
remove it the moment I step out of camp. Well, can only hope that it somehow 
is still in office, perhaps left in the cubicle where I was tasked to do some 
manual labour of shifting cabinets. Speaking of which, erm, my job scope now 
really is more like an odd job labourer, lol, good pay for simple work.
