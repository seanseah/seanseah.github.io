Its getting into the crazy school period once again, with FYP, 
assignments, tests, tons coming and no reprieve in sight. Yet, in the midst of 
it all, the blasphemy has begun with the planning of Holidays. Andy made a 
pertinent point, I have been working on my thesis for such a long period of 
time that now I am so sick of it. Haha. Argh, lost the urge, the pressure to 
really cramp it out. Its like short term intense pain vs a long bout of 
suffering. 

Ending my exams on the 3rd of May, I have 
thrown the FYP Thesis submission date on the 11th of May into disregard. 

First Stop: 
Phuket: 6th (1800) to 9th (2100) Confirmed 

Back to Thailand once again, after almost 
a year, back to bumming out, back to sun (hopefully) and lots of fun I hope :) 

Second Stop: 
Taipei: 15th to 22nd Confirmed**** 

Finally some place new! 5 days this time, 
hmm, not sure how much we can see and what we can do, but still looking 
forward to it, and we have more than enough time to just explore the entire 
capital.

Edit @ 0948Hrs: Wahhh, finally after much changing and planning, we finally 
settled on an the dates to go for Taiwan.. ok 15th to 22nd. Now is to hope for 
a party of 4 and then for the next stop: Itinerary Planning!
