¡Hola! Mi nombre es Sean, y estoy veinticuatro años de 
edad este año. Por cierto, yo hablo un poco de español.Hello! My name is Sean, and I am 24 years old this year. By 
the way, I speak a little Spanish :). ![](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_m5e8Pqc8k3c/Savlbe2XrOI/AAAAAAAAFtk/f-rdT2hcL9c/s1600/hola%20logo%5B13%5D.jpg)I started Spanish lessons on Jan 21, and it runs every 
Saturday for 2 hours. I am currently into my 7th lesson now and while its 
difficult, its actually quite fun. The challenge is that learning any language 
needs alot of time and effort, which is something I am lacking. Normally, I 
only spend the Saturday as my so-called Spanish day, heh.. sometimes rushing 
homework in the morning before heading to classes. Oh 
shucks.. it’s 7 lessons already and I still can’t really converse in basic 
Spanish, guess I really need to practice more. The bad thing about the lessons 
are that its almost fully conducted in Spanish, and the first few lessons 
really had difficulty trying to understand the teacher, ended up playing a 
guessing game most of the time. Anyway, hope to one day put all these Spanish 
lessons to good use by going on a trip to Spain, Europe and well, the many 
other Spanish speaking countries in the world.
