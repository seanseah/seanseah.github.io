Singapore time now is 5:40pm, its been 18 hrs since I left Singapore and I 
am still stuck on the plane. I also happened to be very bored. Haha… slept 
enough though so ain’t really that tired. This time around, happened to be my 
first experience with ANA and its pretty good, no complains about the food and 
service, the inflight entertainment has some of the newer shows but nothing 
really caught my fancy, ended up completing 2 shows, “Vicky, Christina and 
Barcelona” and “Suspect X”, recommended by Andy, the Galileo TV Series movie. 
I also watched part of “Seven Pounds” and that was useful in lulling me to 
sleep.  Thanks to travelling with 2 Krisflyer Gold members, I enjoyed 
quite a fair bit of the privileges, the shorter check-in or boarding queues, 
the usage of the lounge etc. We spent the 3 hrs transit time at the ANA Lounge 
in Narita, free food, drinks. There was a noodle bar so tried some tempura 
soba, quite decent and also took one melon-pan, however, think anime made it 
look much nicer.  Another 8 hrs more before I can reach my hotel. I am 
missing home already :).
