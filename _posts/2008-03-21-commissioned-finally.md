15th of March came and went, yet 
it was a day of many memories, and more importantly, closing off a chapter in 
my life. Been working (or at least I thought I had been) quite hard for this 
event and now just feeling bittersweet that it's over. The 1 hour 20 min on 
the parade square went by like a blur, as compared to the many rehearsals we 
had. We were also quite lucky in the sense that the new SSM that took over 
believed in more practical training methods as opposed to stern punishment and 
hey, I went through the 3 weeks without having to run round the parade square 
=).

Happiest moment! - "Re-entry for fixing on of epaulettes" 

The 
cheers and celebration spirit were high as we slowed march into the tunnel, 
from there, dumping down all the weapons and a sort of mini celebration ensued 
as we started congratulating one another. The re-entry portion singing the OCS 
song wasn't tear-jerking as I thought it would be, haha... but just felt very 
elated that its coming to a close and finally can see my friends and loved 
ones. 
Tears 
welled up moment! - "Marching 
into the parade square" 
 
Surprisingly, the initial entrance into the parade square was the 
most difficult, in terms of nerves, and in terms of emotions. Just kinda 
touched by the whole atmosphere, and being able to finally start the parade, 
with the crowd applause, with the throes of "We are one" in the background, I 
just felt like crying then and there. That would have been quite a sight, 
haha...

Most boring moment! - "Speech.. yawn" 
 
The 
things about parade, you spend so much time standing there, that the mind 
often wanders and during rehearsals I have accidentally drifted off and missed 
out commands. Luckily that didn't happen on the actual day though :). So 
during the 10 min speech, I was just stoning there, dreaming about food, 
humming "apologise by one republic" to myself, basically trying to will the 10 
minutes away.

Most regretted moment! - "Marchpast" 
 
Ah.. screwed up. 

Haha.. 
the thing about being Contingent Commander was to make sure that the commands 
given must be good so that everything will proceed smoothly, yet on the actual 
day, I was a bundle of nerves during the marchpast (the most important bit 
actually) and kinda messed things up by giving the command somewhat offbeat. 
Shucks. The good thing was that it seemed that most people didn't catch it and 
well, we did somehow manage to rectify it quickly, so hmmm...
