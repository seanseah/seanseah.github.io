COE prices dipped abit recently, plus a little peer pressure from 
the rest of the course mates, kinda gian to buy the car now. Anyway, its only 
2 more months before my official work kicks in, so just about right timing to 
buy it now. Headaches though, haha.. can't really decide what car to buy. 
Help? 

First up.. Hyundai Avante. Korean car, so 
getting some negative vibes about it haha, but it looks not too bad, drive is 
good, responsive, interior trimmings are also ok, quite like the finishing 
inside though no factory fitted audio. The exterior is kinda round, not really 
appealing to me, however its rather zhng-able, (refer to 2nd pic), making it 
have a more edgy front... but that means more $$.

The Lancer Ex. Loved the look of the car 
when I saw it the first time. It definitely has a very aggressive look 
especially the front styling and sharp lines, yet its a car that is lacking in 
the drive component. I'm not a fast / hard driver so its not too bad, however 
the loudness of the engine, the relatively slow pickup aren't appealing. So it 
begs the question of whether is it worth the 62k. 

![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_m5e8Pqc8k3c/RyRe7dhPkUI/AAAAAAAADT8/BpNnwLrHnlM/s1600/lancer-ex.jpg)Had never really considered the Jazz until saw 
the others trying it. A hatchback, which to some extent, all hatches look the 
same, so wonders whether it is worth paying a premium for one. Hmm, 57k, 1k 
more than the Avante. The drive is good, Honda's engine and all that is 
possibly the best for the Asian region, and even the Jazz benefits from it.  
It should be weaker than the Avante, but given the small nature of the car, 
still feels rather zippy. 

![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_m5e8Pqc8k3c/RyRe7thPkVI/AAAAAAAADUE/by_kNF2j_cA/s1600/jazz-thumb.jpg)So well, end of the day, mainly considering 
these 3 choices. Hmm... there are definitely a few other cars out there for 
this price range, but with 3, already having one headache over which to 
choose!
