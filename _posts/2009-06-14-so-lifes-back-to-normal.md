I have collected my car already... At least life has re-acquired some form 
of normalcy once again which is a relief, and that explains the blog title. 
The car repair was done quite well, as they had to change the entire door, 
also, the damaged rear area was cut out and replaced too. Total cost hovered 
within the region of around $4,000 plus and that will now be taken up with the 
other insurance, subject to the success of the 3rd party claim. 
Birthday was great, and I fully made use of my birthday off. Started a tad 
early with a late night gaming session with JC friends at Katong, having a 
blast killing undead zombies and vice versa. The actual day wax spent with 
dear at the zoo which was fun, marred slightly by working calls in the middle 
which ended a little hot tempered. Anyway, putting aside work, the zoo might 
not have changed much but it has revamped itself with new shows, making it 
more interesting. It was a tiring day and when we left the zoo, we were 
physically drained and just nua-ed at bukit timah sixth avenue.  ![](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_m5e8Pqc8k3c/SjUM1yG57VI/AAAAAAAAGhE/-4J2glwhoeA/s1600/019%5B2%5D.jpg) 
Dinner was at Brazil Churrascaria. An overly meat indulgent meal specially 
chosen for me, it was just the place for a meat feast. Many various cuts / 
styles of meat to try and for the adventurous, chicken hearts and livers. To 
be honest, the normal style of meats were more than enough for me and it 
admittedly was a little meat excessive. We enjoyed ourselves, but probably not 
going to re-visit the place any time soon.  ![](http://lh5.ggpht.com/_m5e8Pqc8k3c/SjUM4IDTaKI/AAAAAAAAGhM/Wwmly9wtw3Q/s1600/049%5B2%5D.jpg)
