It's been storming these last few days, especially during the wee hours of 
the morning. I had to wake up two days in a row to restore power after the 
crazy lightning storm we been having… sheesh, crazy weather nowadays.  
Thinking that it wouldn’t rain again so soon, I went out to pay my bills 
and damn, it started pouring when I reached Kembangan. Waited for awhile to 
see if the rain would subside but the skies just grew darker and darker and 
decided that I might as well rush back home. It was a chilly ride back. 
Anyway, something totally random… Mas Selamat got caught but before that, 
he was selling Ramly Burgers? Haha…
