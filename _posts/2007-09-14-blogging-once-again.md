Hmm, haven't been updating this page for quite sometime again, in camp, don't 
really have the freedom or personal time to reflect or write about events... 
Life in camp has been pretty eventful, quite 'happening' with 29 of us, but 
yet very tiring with late nights and early mornings. One of the best thing so 
far is clearing my ippt, signs of my feet recovering and overcoming all the 
other nitty gritty stuff.On a completely irrelevant note, the Singtel 
Broadband mobile has really been quite useful and the 10 gig usage is more 
than sufficient. On the go browsing, checking emails, msn, sbs bus guide, and 
possibly many more other uses that are just begging to be discovered, just 
makes for a very integrated experience and 3g is definitely more fun that 
wifi, where it can be quite a pain in the ass to connect. The whole thing just 
makes me like my phone even more!
