Currently on night shift this week, and 
this couple of nights have been good to me, allowing me to reach home by 
around 1:45am? Haha, compared to my first week on night duty, this has been 
rather pleasant. Even now, perhaps still feeling the effects of the coffee, I 
am unable to sleep and still feeling rather awake hence this late night post. 
Have turned on the aircon and waiting for the temperature to lower abit before 
turning in for the night. I still have a couple of blog posts outstanding or 
kept in phone but with the lack of opportunity and time to craft each post, 
shall just add an impromptu one and make it short and sweet. 

It has been an interesting week to say the least, but as each day goes by, I 
really understand how hard it is to be an officer, to provide the necessary 
support, to groom and train, and to also take care of the people under your 
charge. Each individual really have their own needs and wants, and coupled 
with our own, sometimes conflicts do occur and yet, it is indeed challenging 
to remain fair on all accounts. There's just so much to do, and so little 
time, and really looking forward to a break to just recuperate and recover the 
energy to see myself through this job. 

On a sidenote, I'm gonna be 24 soon. Wee :) Wonder whether growing old might 
finally bring me better luck. :P This year had it's fair share of problems, 
from injuries, car issues, to work issues. Oh man, really looking forward to a 
tad brighter year ahead! At the moment, loving my car, collected it on the 
16th of May, have already sent it for the 1k servicing thus far, and other 
than the less than stellar road holding, it has not disappointed me. Still 
wanting to go modify the front bumper and grille but holding out now due to 
the lack of time to go source for good bodykit / grille etc.
