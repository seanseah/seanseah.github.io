Commencement in a couple of days time.. 
last trip to NUS as a student, finally going to graduate and get my 
certificate and all. Hmm, is it going to be a significant event? Reminds me of 
those prize presentation ceremony in earlier school days, line up by the sides 
of the stage, walk up, shake hands, collect whatever you are suppose to 
collect, bow, thanks, walk off. Hmm, there's still the stupid gown to 
consider, how to put it on and all that, and gosh, had to actually view a 
webcast to find out the way, err, my gown short of a hook/strap or something 
hmm, anyway, seems like have to end up using safety pins, such an unfriendly 
gown! 

So well, that marked my last webcast, my goodbye to a friendly tool that has 
allowed me to skip lectures, and yet not feel guilty about it, my lullaby at 
home that drives me to bed each time the lecturer starts talking.. 

What am I looking for. Hmm....
