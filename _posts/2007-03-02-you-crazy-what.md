From school to Botak Jones then off to Clarke Quay! Its been Botak 
Jones in quick succession having just gone there with Jiali yesterday after 
previous failed attempts to go there. Had heard so much about the place before 
from the multiple food blogs to Hardwarezone outings and yet, haven't gone 
there before until last night. It was packed, and well, when browsing through 
the menu, with the name such as "YOU-CRAZY-WHAT" and a description as follows: 

THREE BEEF PATTIES, THAT’S 450 GRAMS OF HAND FORMED BEEF!! I-S MAGAZINE ONCE ASKED 
“ARE YOU MAN ENOUGH?” I ASK, “ARE YOU CRAZY?!!"

### Challenge Accepted! How to back down! 
haha.., just had to try it I suppose and see what all the fuss was about. 
After ordering, had like 2nd thoughts! especially with jiali saying like her 
friend ordered it last time and couldn't finish and it was really alot, 
anyway, it didn't take too long to come, and I set about my task wolfing it 
down! Jumping to the conclusion, I did manage to finish it! Woohoo :) 

It wasn't a tortue to wolf it down as it 
was quite nice actually. Also, it was totally not worth to order with the 
cheese for this as it comes up to an extra 3 dollars, since its a dollar per 
patty. Shall just make do with more chilli/mustard next time.
