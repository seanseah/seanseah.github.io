Woe betides me. I have fallen for the common cliché of the most commercialized day in history - Valentine's Day.

Buildup to the day was hectic but still very much fun. I must really thank Andy and Linghuey for helping me with the ideas, settings, and keeping me company as we go about shopping!

To spruce up the place, I even gotten some scented candles for a more romantic setting. Didn't know how to place the candles initially and yep, Andy gave me the idea of floating them in water and it was by chance that I had a nice transparent ice bucket at home. It was a whirlwind rush that day, as I had to submit my assignments in school, picked up flowers, then shop for ingredients (I decided to go with Pasta - the easiest?), before heading over to home in Punggol.

And finally, present exchange time! Besides the lovely presents, I was serenaded by songs played by a lovely pianist - couldn't ask for more. Maybe Valentine's might not be so bad after all.
