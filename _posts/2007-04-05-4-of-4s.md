wow. 3 years ago, Ban Hua wanted to surprise LH for her birthday, 
and today, its like coming full circle of the NUS years and we are doing the 
same thing again, albeit without the main organiser but his presence was still 
felt nonetheless. And previously it was JEC Kbox, and now it was just a few 
roads across at IMM, strangely deja-vu.

The surprise party making its entrance! 

Wah, after our entrance, we settled down, ordered, and ate like my 2nd dinner? 
The dinner conversation was like peppered with bits and pieces of other people 
and how small and connected the world is, as like how people tend to know 
other people's friends and especially with so many people around, conversation 
tend to centered among those you sit with, at least I was still in familiar 
territory...

The box is what Ivy and me got for linghuey, with a corny poem on the underside 
and a pair of earrings inside. Hmm turned 
out that LH already had one identical pair, hmmmm... shows that ivy knows her 
very well ?? haha. And oh, there's the 
closeup of the cake.

everybody squeeze ... 

I was just so tired by this time. I am quite an early person. 
I just wanted to go home, especially when 
everybody else stayed so near, but well, going back late at night has its 
advantages, a speedy bus makes much haste.
