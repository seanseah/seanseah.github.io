After a grueling 30 hours, of which 21 hours flying time and 9 hrs transit, I made it! I am in Orlando, Florida. It’s summer now so the weather is exactly like back home. At least there’s aircon in the room :) This is going to be a short trip, 4 days to be exact and no weekend to explore as well, probably even less free time than the last work trip I was on. Oh well, at least it is a different place and I shall make the most out of it. 

Had a call from my boss when I landed in Orlando, called me a couple of times so I thought it was urgent. Wrong assumption. Wasted 2 minutes of roaming charges as he called me to ask for a phone number. Argh! I am not a telephone directory. Isn’t there suppose to be a different ringtone when one is overseas? 

Anyway, seems that one advantage of travelling this time of the year is the summer sales, coupled with their big sale for the Independence Day weekend. Should be quite a fruitful haul :) This aim was also shared by the travelling group. It's always about shopping. Not much time to visit the touristy spots either.
