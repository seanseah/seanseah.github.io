Its been sometime since I blogged about personal stuff, haha. Oh 
well… its been a “busy” week. FYP, 
assignment, projects, really never ending stuff. A semester where I no longer 
feel in control in a way, haha. 

Well, of pastries and pancakes, 
symbolizing the death and birth of a week. Last week ended off nicely, with a 
lazy Sunday breakfast followed by lazing around, walking, watching Heroes… 
 
When so many other things are buzzing 
around, its nice to stop and relax, take a breather (but lots of such breaks 
have been taken). It was then chocolate chip pancakes, never tried such a 
combination before which was pretty tasty. 

On Wednesday, felt like a runaway train, 
and the train didn't get too far either, terminating at 西天娘娘, hope she wasnt 
too annoyed :S. Well if any, blame it on the latte? Rusty fingers doesn’t help 
when I’m on a coffee high, sigh, coffee really have terrible effects on me. 
Sometimes its ok, and I get a positive buzz from it? And sometimes its just 
messes with my stomach / mood / tired and more. Shall really try to abstain. 
Abstain with all my lion strength =). 

Coming to the end of the week at least for 
me! Thursday marks the end of it, Friday a break and shall probably use the 
weekend to clear up my FYP thesis finally. And oh, I was talking to Jiali 
about my grandma egg dishes and as I came home for dinner.. steamed egg!

Simple 
dish, but very nice leh, and I guess she goes to alot of effort to do all the 
garnishing, although she says its easy, just chopping only. But still... not 
something I can do, simple happy dinner.
