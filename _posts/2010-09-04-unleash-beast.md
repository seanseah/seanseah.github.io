I bought my CPU, the AMD 
Phenom II X2 550, a dual core processor last year based on the multiple 
reviews that it could be unlocked to a quad core. To simplify things, the 
Phenom II X2 (dual core) is nothing more than a Phenom II X4 (quad core) with 
two cores  disabled. Originally these cores were disabled because of low 
yields,  but over time yields on quad-core Phenom IIs should be high enough to 
 negate the need for a Phenom II X2. There in lies the simplicity of this 
unlock. However, when I first got my motherboard and processor, it didn't work 
and I was disheartened. Yet, it was definitely powerful enough to support / 
run whatever I had to throw at it and I was happy. 

Just last night, I was checking out the price of a new quad core as I was 
looking at the pricelists to set up a new computer for my cousin. I am not 
sure why, but was suddenly tempted to try the unlocking again. This morning, I 
downloaded a new bios, played around with the settings and lo and behold :) it 
was done! I got my 4 processors working and everything else is working great.
