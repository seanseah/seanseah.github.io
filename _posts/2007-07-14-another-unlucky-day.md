It was Friday the 13th 
[again](http://geek-looking-glass.blogspot.com/2007/04/happiest-friday-13th.html)... 

and this time around, got a surprise from 
jiali as she got me 13 little things on the day I took leave to watch Harry 
Potter =). Well, this erm, once upon a time "unlucky" day, is fast becoming a 
day to look forward to on the calendar! Thank you for remembering this special 
day and celebrating it with me! 

Caught Harry Potter, an afternoon 
screening with all the JC / sec school students.. hmm.. felt different, as 
have not watched shows at this time for awhile? See all the JC students going 
out after lessons in a big group kinda reminds me of my JC days where we were 
we foolishly dragged to watch those chick flicks... or were those during the 
hols hmm.. oh well, we were always kings of wasting time, and could easily 
spend a day after school not doing anything =) 

Anyway, liked the show.. looking forward 
to the book even more! It should be released soon and well, curious about 
finding out who ends up with who and who dies!
