Never a big fan of such tests, but well, its a really fast one, like 
can be done in 5 sec, does it apply to me? Kinda.. haha.

"You feel as if you have missed out on a great 
deal that life had to offer and you go about trying to make up for past 
failures. Naturally at times you get depressed and you try to compensate for 
your 'missed opportunities' by living your life to the full. This is what, 
perhaps, may be described as 'living with exaggerated intensity'. In this way 
you feel you can break the chains of the past and start again - and it could 
be that you are right. 

You are lazy - you dream of a peaceful, calm, 
uncluttered and uncomplicated life. Your ideal would be to share a permanent 
base with some person or persons who would be able to demonstrate on-going 
love, peace and security. 

You need a friend - a close friend - and you are 
willing to become emotionally involved with the right person, but you are very 
demanding and particular in your choice of partners. You are constantly 
looking for reassurance and it is perhaps because of this that you tend to be 
somewhat argumentative, but you try to hold back - careful to avoid open 
conflict - since this might reduce your prospects of realising your hopes of 
establishing a warm caring relationship. 

Nobody seems to understand you at this moment 
for everything you suggest or do seems to be taken up the wrong way. All of 
this misunderstanding is leading to anxiety and stress. The situation 
naturally is not as you would like it to be - you feel that you are being 
treated most unfairly and that trust, affection and understanding are being 
withheld from you and that you are being treated with a demeaning lack of 
consideration. You consider yourself being denied the appreciation essential 
to your well being and self-esteem and that there is nothing you can do about 
it. You feel that whatever you try to do to change the situation, you are 
getting nowhere fast. You would really like to get away from it all but can't 
find the energy or the strength of mind to make the necessary decision. 

The tensions that you are trying to cope with 
are a result of conditions which are really beyond your control. As a 
consequence of this almost impossible situation and not being able to get your 
own way, you are subjected to frustration and almost ungovernable anger. You 
are trying to remedy the situation but the stress that you are experiencing is 
making the situation even worse. You feel so inadequate that you are not quite 
sure which way to turn. A good suggestion would to be to try to relieve the 
stress and anxiety by participating in some very active physical activity 
which will relieve your tension."
