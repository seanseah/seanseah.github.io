My favourite photo of the day! And today's special too, as it is the Friday the 13th, which is also 10 more days to first paper! So I guess this is a celebration of sorts? Well, reaching almost the end of school and all the major headaches of FYP and projects are over and what's left is 3 exams + 1 project. Life can give you lemons at times. But it is up to us to turn things around, and unbelievably cliche as it may be, lemonade is one awesome drink. Friday the 13th is always associated as an unlucky day, but hey, we pretty much had an awesome time.

Without further digress about work, we went to Jurong Hill today, where what lies on top is this **Japanese and Indonesian Hilltop Restaurant**, and yes, the name is indeed so boringly creative. Well, its a nice place, and shall just let the pictures speak for themselves.

Well, that marks the end of this 'unlucky day'. The view from Jurong Hill overlooks that of the Pier and all the industrial sites. Despite late into the night, it was still busying itself with traffic and life. It was a place that had seemed to come to a standstill in the 80s as the world moved along. The lookout tower itself was old but still sturdy, with a spiral path upwards, very similar to those spiral carparks which I am no big fan of. It also had a beautiful stained glass decoration at the top with bright green colours and despite the brunt of old age, still looked very good. I wonder if it would look better if the sun was brighter, hmm.

As for the restaurant, it had a nostalgic theme, hmm it probably wasn't a theme, rather just that it hasn't change since then. The 80s era was obvious from the lighting, wallpaper, paintings and even the waitress looks like they have been there since then! It gave off a very quaint and yet, captivating feel and it was a pleasant dining experience. A nice getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city. They don't have an authentic Japanese chef, instead it was a Chinese national, but no complains about the food. It was prepared well, food was fresh, and pricing is also very very reasonable, just that eating at the Teppanyaki table leaves one with a buttery garlic smell.
