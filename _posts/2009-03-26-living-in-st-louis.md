It’s been pretty boring thus far. Haha.. other than eat / shop, we have not 
really done much else. Sales at Osage Factory Outlet Village were pretty good 
and I got quite a number of items there, but it was an almost 3 hrs drive away 
and that sucks. Other than that, the usual malls here are pretty boring, been 
to St Louis Galleria and Mills thus far. Was thinking whether should make a 
trip down to see the Arch but everybody here have nothing positive to say 
about it so will probably not go check it out.  I also happen to be 
sleeping very early and waking up EARLIER as the days pass, which is weird. 
This is some crazy sleeping timing. Oh well.. its time to go home soon :). 
Shall miss this relax pace lifestyle…
