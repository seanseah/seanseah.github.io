Wishing upon a star.. 
That someone out there will be all tucked in bed.. 

Sleeping soundly and that the sweetest dreams may enchant her.. 
No random thoughts, no updates recently. Just been living day to day, somewhat 
free yet still finding free time lacking.. Days of attachment once again 
ending and saying goodbye to this freedom once more. Gosh, christmas is just 
around the corner too, with it slightly more than a month away, wee.. Holiday 
season coming up, the holidays that we always look forward to, will now be 
spent working. What a difference.. A year makes.
