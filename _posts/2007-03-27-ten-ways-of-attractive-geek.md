Just read this article, "[Ten 
Ways Being a Geek Makes You More 
Attractive](http://mingle2.com/blog/view/10-ways-being-a-geek-makes-you-more-attractive)" and hey of course, that applies to me! Of 
course, the natural thing will be to proceed down the checklist of 10 items, 
seeing which applies to me. So, erm, I might be some way off, but I'm slowly 
getting there! 
1. **You're probably very smart. **hmm... well, applies to me? Yes, I 
DO think so. Hahaha. 
1. **It's hip to be geek.**Nope, this 
doesn't apply to me. But hey, at least I'm not THAT scrawny, no thick glasses, 
and erm, I am at least good for a Hi or two? Fashionable geeks, hmm, seems 
like apply to the apple fanboys more! I'm still too much of a geek's geek =\. 
**You geek out on more than just your 
computer.**  
"Ever seen the movie collection of a film 
geek? Ever had an automotive geek work on your car? Ever seen the body of a 
fitness geek? The tenacity of someone like us, when applied to hobbies outside 
computers and the like, can yield impressive results." 

Ooo... my tenacity might be abit lacking, but yeah, my interest definitely 
lies in more than computers alone, how about lightsaber swinging for a 
change?**Geek humor is the best 
humor.** 
Well, I tend to laugh at my own jokes? Who cares what you think? 
=)**You listen to good music.** 
Definitely! Bring on some REAL music! (Like those played by way too old 40 
year old, tummy bulging, guitar banging old man with long hair)**You make good money.** 
Nope, not true not true. I'm a poor sad case. Donations 
welcomed!**You fix stuff.** 
ZZZZZZ. People remember you for a bad reason haha.**You've got your own stuff going on. ** 
Hmm, well true, but they are all geek stuff (mostly), not like that is such a 
bad thing in hindsight. I will never run out of things to do, or get bored. 
Yay.. *rushes out to overload my room with more Star Wars toys***You're very articulate.**  
"Compulsively reading a few hundred RSS 
feeds a day yields a vocabulary that could put most college English majors to 
shame."Oops, but my thesis got torn to 
shreds for its language! Still in a desolate spirit after that episode. Ah.. 
the reason why is because I only have 28 RSS feeds, (yeah, actually 
counted)... **You're 
passionate.** 
Yeah, talk about my craze for album art collection, of only wanting whole 
albums, of wanting movie folder art, of renaming every thing. Sometimes, 
passion can be mistaken as a form of enslaving obsession. And cough cough, 
what's not to like about a guy who's passionate?
