Today marks quite a sad day as I heard the news of a fellow ece 
undergraduate who had passed away only yesterday. I was not that close to him, 
but knew him to be a strong, independent person who was very much capable in 
all he do. Initial impression was that he was an easy going person and yet in 
some ways, the path he walked was similar to mine. Feeling quite saddened by 
his loss, but yet, not much can be done now, except to learn from his lesson 
and remember that the easiest way out is not the best and can be such a 
selfish choice to the people around you. 

On a brighter note, last semester in NUS, 
and more milestones have now been reached. Today marks the day of being the 
last lecture, last test and the ending of one module, Cybercrime! 3 of us took 
the test together, and upon the half hour mark, we were also the first 3 to 
leave the room. Most of the questions were repeats of previous sems and I 
guess it wasn't that hard a paper but nonetheless, still some mistakes here 
and there. Only 3 more modules to clear. As for changing my thesis, well, some 
changes will be required but really not in much hurry to do them. In the 
meantime, there's still one more project that's left to be done and that will 
take up some time. I shall not procrastinate this time around and get down to 
doing it, hopefully after I reach home. 

Today was also engin welfare day, cheapo 
me walked away with 2 bottles of Snapple, haha.. but the drink is terrible! 
Horribly flat tasting. Oh one more milestone, barring any future surprises, 
this should be the last time I get stuck at the usual 7pm Tanjong Pagar jam, 
and no, I am not really relishing the moment, but this is like a continuation 
of the blogging on bus miniseries. Looking forward to no more butt aches!
