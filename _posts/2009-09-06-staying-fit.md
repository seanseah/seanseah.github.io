I am all of a sudden motivated 
once again to start exercising and whipping my body into shape once more. This 
feeling has came and gone for quite a few times in my life and I have to admit 
that each moment of burst it has at least forced me to keep in relatively 
decent shape which is a good thing. I have all too often let myself lose to 
the laziness. Well, how long will this new found momentum be able to carry 
itself? I doubt it will last more than a week or two to be honest, what with 
work getting in the way and all. I can't blame it on anything other than 
myself considering that there's a gym in the office but I hardly use it, more 
keen to head home instead of spending precious time there. Perhaps its a 
mentality that I should be changing. Let's see how the next few weeks take me.
