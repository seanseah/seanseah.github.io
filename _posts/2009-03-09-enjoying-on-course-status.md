Do you know? the average person has …  1. Public Holidays = 11 
 1. 1/2 Days = 1 (Day off, misc etc) 
 1. Annual Leave = 21 
 1. Medical Leave = 5 
 1. Organisation non working days = 2 
 1. Training = 4 
 For a total of 44 non-work days! And since no. of workdays in a 
year = 260, that leaves us with 216 working days. Hmm… fruit for thought. So 
if we are only to work 8 hrs a day, we are only productive for 20% of the time 
the entire year. Hmm.. maybe that’s why there’s just so much OT required. 
Anyway, looking at last year, I didn’t take any medical leave (damn), 
should have reported sick whenever felt like it. But then again, nah.. its not 
good to be ill, unless for minor instances.  This year, seems to have 
many opportunities for training, but local courses am still often required to 
return to clear some work. But not all the time though, like today, came back 
home rather early. Courses are also great opportunities to meet up and catch 
up with friends so well, that’s a great thing. And hey.. I have the chance to 
go on an overseas course again soon! Definitely looking forward to it…
