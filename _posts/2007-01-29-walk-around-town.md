I didn't have much to do today, so I had the task of returning my library books and decided to go for a city stroll in the Esplanade area.

I also got my guitar strings at Davis; yes, I actually play the guitar. It was one of the few achievements from my JC days—learning to play a number of simple basic chords on the guitar. I never really moved beyond that, though, and I don’t even dare to call myself an amateur.
