Didn't had much to do today, and had the task of 
returning my library books, so went down esplanade area for a city stroll. 

Got my guitar strings at Davis too, yes I actually play the guitar. 
It was one of the few achievements in my JC days - learning to play a number of simple basic chords on the guitar. 
Never really moved beyond that though, and I do not even dare to call myself 
an amateur.
