I have not blogged for awhile. Now is an appropriate time to start again as 
at least it provides an alternative means of communication with Jiali now that 
she will be working in Shanghai over the next couple of months. Anyway, life 
has changed quite a fair bit since the last time I blogged. I have been 
fortunate to travel quite a fair bit (be it for work or leisure) and have now 
increased the number of places I have visited this year. Looking ahead across 
the short term horizon, more opportunities to come as Florida and Vietnam 
awaits.  I have just came back from France for a work trip. It was 
indeed an eye opener as this was the first trip I actually had to prepare on 
my own as I was the assigned staff officer. Hence, from getting the trip 
approval to settling the funds, it was a brand new experience from me and 
indeed, I have grown from it. Oh well.. going to be a long day ahead.. 
from 5am tmr, the next 30 hours will be spent living in aeroplanes and 
airports. sheeshâ€¦
