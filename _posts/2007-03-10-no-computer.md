Haha.. being so reliant on my computer, turning it on the moment I wake up, 
and then off usually only when I'm asleep, is it possible for me to withdraw 
from it? Yeah, I guess very much so, thinking about the reasons why I use the 
computer, its really very much for information, or dabbling with things. 
There's that tinker-ing nature in me, which isn't exactly very good at what it 
does, but still there. 

Now -&gt; Google Reader, my vice for all RSS feeds 

Couple of months ago -&gt; Digg, Lifehacker etc 

Longer -&gt; Hardwarezone Forums 

And of course, my best friend. Google. Haha. 

I guess, its just something to take time away from myself, having nothing to 
do, I need to occupy it. Last night, I learn that my life is just 
insignificant enough to be void of nothing, and so all these just fills it up. 

So I guess, if one were to take all this away, I would just rely on the older 
form of information. Books. I guess its like how with my computer around, I 
read the newspaper less? Since I already get such an overdose of information 
(be it useless) everyday or every moment I am at my comp that I hardly want to 
read the papers and instead just flipped through it. Like when I'm overseas, 
which also shows how less computer reliant I can be, I would actively sought 
out papers and would be more interested to read them cover to cover. 

And oh, there's always being just a TV freak too. Just last night, watched the 
last 2 movies of American Pie + 1 episode of 我猜. However, that would rely on 
me using my computer so I guess that's out. Books for the win!
