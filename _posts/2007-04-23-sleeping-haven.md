Innkeeper: "Would you like to rest here tonight?" 
Chrono / Kaer: "Yeah!" 
Innkeeper: "That would cost you 100 gold." 
Chrono / Kaer: "!! I should just go 
home."

... my bed ... 
Nice? Haha.. my old bedsheet is just so 
cool. Sesame Street, still can see all the popular characters. There are 6 
Sesame Street characters on the bedsheet, hmm, most of the popular ones are 
there, those lacking will be Kermit, the Count.. and hmm.. Argh. I didn't even 
liked the show last time, hated it, it was so very boring, would rather they 
show some cartoons instead. The blanket is probably even more kua zhang, 
ULTRAMAN. That's a permanent feature on my bed as opposed to the bed sheet 
which does get rotated with some erm, less cartoony ones from time to time. 

All my bed accessories has lasted me so 
long, some probably even outlived me. Well, as they say, all good things must 
come to an end. 

 
... a new good ... 
The "new" photo comes out so bland and 
washed out! Not going to bother retaking though. 

Time to ring in the change, my dad got me 
a quilt cover. He bought it after I just casually mentioned it in passing, 
ahh... 
 
It can be a tad too warm though, 
especially with my room occasionally resembling that of an oven. But its all 
soft and fuzzy and most importantly, nice to sleep on top of too! For those 
nights where tucking under is just too unbearable. The pillows are changed as 
well, so goodbye to those older than me pillows which have gone a little limp 
and less and less comfortable.
