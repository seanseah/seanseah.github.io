of July, it was back to school.. with friends and family to well.. finally 
graduate. Some people took their kindergarten photo in the robes etc.. but I 
didn't had the opportunity to do so last time, so well, finally time to don it 
on =) 

The last 4 years has been eventful to say the least, starting off with how I 
ended up there in the first place. Making the decision to take up the 4 years 
bond, allowed me to enter university straight away then, an advantage so to 
speak. Trading in the green uniform for a temporary lull of 4 years of 
civilian life, hours spent in lecture halls, rushing projects, stoning on the 
long ride to and fro from school. Was it a decision to regret? Well, the pay 
isn't that great, prospects looks dim, potentially lots of travelling, need 
for a car, politics? But yet,  the 4 years was definitely worth it. 

Well, wouldn't have grown so close to jiali if we weren't in the same cohort 
and things would have been drastically different I suppose. Owe you a big 
thanks for everything... and really, couldn't have done it without you. 
Made friends 
with a bunch of great people along the way, and to each and everyone, thank 
you! It has made the 4 years at NUS so much enjoyable, be it the projects 
where we always rush at the last moment, the mugging sessions at library or 
yih and the lunches that followed where we will discuss the post-exam 
celebrations which somehow never really materialised =o. 
Post Event Celebration ~ Our party of 7 made our way down to Holland V for 
dinner and drinks, first time eating at nydc actually, normally there for 
dessert only, so it was something new, and had a great time at dinner. Due to 
it being a Tuesday and us being working adults, only 4 of us stayed for post 
dinner drinks at Tangos, ah, kenna cheated by their happy hour. Gonna cut down 
on the liquor though, abstinence abstinence, but well, erm, just a drink (or 
two) for a little celebration. Its been too much alcohol recently.
