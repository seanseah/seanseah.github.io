After a week of attempts to leave work 
early to shop for cars ended disappointingly with some days actually leaving 
later than normal, i finally got down to visiting car showrooms and test 
driving the cars i was interested in. Surprisingly or perhaps just being plain 
fickle minded, the fit was no longer a consideration. 

Basically 4 cars were in mind, the toyota 
axio, the honda civic, the hyundai avante and the mitsubishi ex. The first one 
off the list was the axio, the looks just did not appeal to me. I was 
seriously contemplating the civic despite its price. I guess for the civic, 
the 1.8L features were really a class above and I could only settle for the 
1.6L one due to my COE. Furthermore the only stock available was the display 
model. That particular model's condition just wasn't very good and hence, 
shall not pay so much for a seemingly 'second hand' car. That left 2 choices 
and between the 2, despite the lancer more aggressive and popular image, the 
avante just appealed to me after the test drive and it met all my requirements 
for a car. So after one long hassle that has stretched months, I swapped the 
more popular 'H' for the slanted one but yet, still happy that I had a second 
chance to change cars.

drive cars was not about to end yet. This final stop was way out of my 
league. It was a hellish ride, and think I 
crashed at almost every turn haha... We had headed over to Comcentre, where 
Singtel had staged a F1 simulator and I think it is still not really hyped up 
at the moment as the place was rather empty except for their rather 
enthusiastic staff. It was a good experience, it is really uncomfortable to be 
seated in the car for long. To think that for such an expensive car, can't 
they look into making it more comfortable for the driver. Oh well, F1 is 
coming to town, and looks like I gotta work on those days!
