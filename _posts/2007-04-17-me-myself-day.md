Wee. Having settled my passport in the morning, was about to head to 
school to study and for lunch but heard that lib was already overflowing at 
this early hours and that might not seem to be such a great idea after all. 
While considering my next options, remembered about the bak chor mee that Andy 
had introduced last time and started craving for it. Now, this is actually 
quite unlike me but guess being both hungry and thirsty, the long journey 
without a direct bus was far less appetizing. 

Excitements over lunch! Some guy walked in 
with a new drink can, guess he didn't want to buy a drink from the stalls, and 
in smatterings of broken english typical of drink stall uncles, an argument 
ensued. The uncle was quite annoyed and keep asking him to think whether such 
behaviour was correct, wa, using moral high ground over here, scary. Well, it 
ended with the guy walking off and not eating there, oh well. Anyway, lunch 
was great, pleased, especially no vinegar today! 

A wind blows, taking me along. 

I came out from the shop with the plans of 
taking 197 to school but saw bus 80 instead. VIVO CITY. More precisely. B 
&amp; J FREE CONE DAY. Yay, my ice cream haha... Ok, shall then go mug after 
that! For now, to satisfy the ice cream + "greedy for all things free" 
cravings together. I reached Vivo at around 11:45am, and joined the queue 
shortly after. Hmm, they started on time at 12 noon and the queue started 
moving quite fast so it wasn't that long a wait.

the queue ... 

They do have some entertainment stationed 
around, guess it helps make the wait less boring. There was like a cow mascot, 
balloon blower / folder, and glitter artist and some other people lingering, 
hmm. Well, being bored and all, and since the guy asked so nicely, here's my 
little piece of body art. It took me quite a while to scrap it off!

it. Haha.

nice view ... 
Alright, finally after getting the ice 
cream and surviving the aftermath, time to start studying in school but before 
i could even study for long, the head became heavier and soon BAM. SLEEP. 
Well, first real day of studying, could have been better but let's not be 
greedy. Ok this is turning out to be a long long post so shall stop now. The 
whole entry (minus pictures) done on my phone, ain't too shabby eh? Can fight 
with somebody's psp!
