How apt, a day for Sociology and a day to talk about my exam culture with it's own special rituals and routines to get myself in the proper frame of mind for exams. I guess, in a way, it calms me down to know that a routine helps establish a certain form of consistency. Like I guess, sleep + waking early helps ensure I get to the examination halls on time and well today is a bad example of that, by the time I reach, people were already seated inside! My exam cultue is made up of the following quick rules.

Right, first up, sleep, I need *sleep*. Lots. I like to make sure I go into an exam well rested. I don't believe in last minute studying.
_Been getting less and less though as the semesters go by._

Need to please somebody up there, soul searching, *say a little prayer*. I am a free thinker, no particular beliefs, but when it is exam time, I pray to that big man up there, and hope he can help me focus my mind so that I can understand the question fully, and not make any careless mistakes.

Need to have a quick revision / look through before I step into the examination hall.

Need to arrive early.

Need to generate confidence, regardless of whether I should or shouldn't.

Need to listen to my exam anthem. If my trusty iPod Touch is flat, that would throw my momentum off =(. That's why I have backup music on my **E61**.

Well, talking about my anthem, these have been my choice of songs so far. Haha, can't remember Year 1 Sem 1 though. So.. my worst semester linked without a choice of song, haha.. now that explains it...

Sem 1: ?? - ??
Sem 2: Guns n' Roses - Civil War
Sem 3: Beck Anime - Spice of Life
Sem 4: Franz Ferdinand - This Fire
Sem 5: Nightwish - Nemo
Sem 6: Archenemy - Nemesis
Sem 7: Damien Rice - 9 Crimes
Sem 8: Blondie / Kim Ah Joong - Maria

Yes, no more anthems after graduation. I kinda like the Maria song now, especially the Korean version which has a definite more upbeat kick to the chorus. Perhaps I should have set the last song to be ’Graduation Day’ instead.

Anyway, the above list should be taken with a pinch of salt. Especially having taken so many exams now, many of the above have been broken or ignored and the end results did turn out to be still alright. Perhaps, not great but decent. The Exam Culture is more of a ritual that calms me down as I prepare to go to **WAR**!
