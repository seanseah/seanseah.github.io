Ok, have slept through the first night in Utah, doesn't seem to be suffering 
from jet lag which is a good thing. The long flight here was indeed a pain, 
with quite a bit of wait in between, shall need either reading material or 
some entertainment on the way back home a few days later. Utah's a nice place, 
and the place I'm in is definitely self sufficient, with lots of shops round 
the corner. Staying in the base itself has its perks, with food / groceries / 
shops all available but have not really explored yet. The room itself is 
fantastic for the price we are paying so no complains, with the usual works... 

I love the weather here. Its a bit chilly in the morning and nights but other 
than that,  feels great. But that also means I definitely overpacked, haha, 
bringing way too much warm clothes. Oh well, since I'm here already, no 
complains, shall only suffer on the way home.. It's 7 in the morning now, and 
I'm feeling great. Shall head out for a walk soon :) cya.. just realised might 
not be appropriate to bring a camera ard the base.
