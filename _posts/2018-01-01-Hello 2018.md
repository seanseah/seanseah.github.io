Hello 2018!

20s are the exciting times - transiting from studies to work, “the world is your 
oyster”, travelling the world to experience life.

30s are really about facing reality - coming to terms with where you stand in 
your career, your personal life, and also, about death. 

And I am not even halfway through my 30s, but man, this is tough. 

In the span of one year, I said goodbye to my Grandma, my unborn children, and my 
father in law.

But the 30s is about facing reality, and I think compared to my younger terms,
there are many elements which I have come to terms with - and I think, I am more
mature; and also happier than I was previously.
