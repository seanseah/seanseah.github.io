This was my first trip without my parents. It was a liberating moment for me and perhaps an expression of freedom. I had just turned 20 and completed one year at university. While my friends were taking vacation jobs, I wanted to see the world. Thankfully, I found friends to travel with (N, J, M). A mutual friend had gone to Australia to further her studies, and we decided to take the opportunity to visit her and explore Sydney and Melbourne. I was still under 21 and would benefit from the airline family member discount, which was a great incentive to travel.

While planning, J and M had to pull out, leaving just N and me.

From Sydney Airport, we took the shuttle to our hotel in King's Cross. King's Cross has long been known to most Australians as the drugs and red-light capital of Australia. Most who have visited Sydney have wandered through the Cross at one time or another, if only to take a gander at how the "other half" live and play. In 2004, it still had quite a bit of the sleazy side. It was also before TripAdvisor, and the hotel we picked was on the lower end of the review scale, but we made it through!

It was a small rundown motel with just basic amenities provided. As night descended, the area slowly transformed into a hive of activity, with bouncers lining the streets and middle-aged men moving from one venue to another. We were young, naive, but foolhardy. We picked one of the clubs and explored the seedy side of Sydney. It was nothing too exciting; instead, we felt rather intimidated by the bouncers and the demand for us to purchase drinks and tip the performers.

The main highlight of our Sydney visit awaited us. The Sydney Harbour area is home to many of Sydney's famous landmarks, including the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the Opera House, and the Royal Botanic Gardens. They are all in close proximity, allowing us to cover them in a single day. The Royal Botanic Gardens are next to the harbour and offer beautiful views from the top of the hill. There are large trees providing wonderful shade that make for a good rest spot for lunch or just a break. The Sydney Opera House, situated on Sydney Harbour at Bennelong Point, is considered by many to be one of the wonders of the modern world. It is one of Sydney's most popular icons, attracting tourists and travelers from around the globe who visit, photograph, and stand in awe of this cultural center.

Another day was spent in Darling Harbour, which is great for shopping and sightseeing. The area is designed for walking; it is generally flat with footpaths connecting to the Casino and Powerhouse Museum. There are many fountains at the southern end of Darling Harbour, making it a pleasant walk on a bright sunny day.

We signed up for a day tour to the Blue Mountains. The Blue Mountains were declared a World Heritage park in November 2000 due to their outstanding natural values, including biodiversity in plant and animal communities dominated by Australia's unique eucalyptus trees and their stunning landscapes. Part of their famed beauty is attributed to the Three Sisters rock formation towering high above Jamison Valley; we visited it as part of our day tour.

Legend has it that three sisters fell in love with three men from neighboring tribes. As marriage between tribes was forbidden, the men decided to capture the sisters, leading to massive tribal wars. To protect them, an elder witch doctor turned them into stone. The elder was killed during the war, leaving the sisters to erode as stone for eternity. This legend is falsely claimed to be an Aboriginal Dreamtime legend.

We did the typical trek alongside many other tourists. There is a popular bushwalking trail that leads to Echo Point in Katoomba. We traveled down the "Giant Stairway," which consists of 800 steps made of steel and stone down to the valley, followed by about a 1.5 km walk to Katoomba Falls' base. Echo Point is a major lookout offering incredible views of Jamison Valley and the Three Sisters.

As budget travelers, one economical way to get from Melbourne to Sydney was via an overnight NSW train service back in 2004; there are more alternatives now. With budget airfares often cheaper than train fares and shorter travel times available today, there's not much reason left to take the train. At that time, however, it was one of the fastest means of transport; taking an overnight train also meant we saved on one night's accommodation while maximizing our sightseeing time in both cities. But it was uncomfortable! We tried our best to sleep despite the rumble, noise, and occasional stops making for fitful rest. In hindsight, it would have been wiser had we paid a bit more for a sleeping compartment.

Melbourne struck me as more vibrant than Sydney; its buzz and energetic spirit attracted me. Partly this vibrancy comes from Melbourne being home to a diverse community with various groups residing, studying, and working in its suburbs—more so than in Sydney.

In Melbourne itself, three main attractions stood out: Federation Square, Queen Victoria Market, and Crown Casino. The Queen Victoria Market is especially notable as it is the largest open-air market—a great way to immerse oneself in Melbourne's culture and atmosphere. Try timing your visit on Sunday for wine tasting opportunities—a slice of Australian culture!

City life in Melbourne contrasted sharply with Sydney; shops stayed open much later at night. This worked out better for us since we could sightsee during the day and continue shopping or dining after dark.

We spent quite a bit of time at Crown Casino trying (and failing) at roulette tables; however, our last night was memorable as we celebrated while watching Euro 2004 finals between Portugal and Greece at Crown Casino. We were drawn by live telecasts (with bets accepted) as part of this event; Melbourne's Greek community came out in full force—the streets filled with celebrators during those early hours after Greece pulled off an incredible upset.

We also signed up for another day tour along Great Ocean Road while sampling wines at vineyards in Yarra Valley region before sitting in cold conditions waiting for nightly penguin march at Philip Island. Even though this trip occurred nearly ten years ago now, I still vividly remember witnessing those little penguins emerge from surf as they waddled safely back into their dune burrows—an amazing sight! Do bring warm clothing; night temperatures combined with strong coastal winds can make for a chilling experience!
