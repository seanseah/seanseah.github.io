Why can't I sleep?? 

I am desperate for a much 
needed rest, yet the mind is rioting, feeling an abundance of energy that does 
not make any sense at all in this wee hours of the night. Worst of all, it is 
only thursday.. signifying one more working day still. 

Haha, knowing that I need to 
work tmr, and yet, I am blatantly disregarding that portion, sheesh.. what am 
I thinking? The brain is like overexcited, yet not knowing about what... 
yawnnnzzz. Could it be the food I ate? Argh, really need to stop over eating 
(and not even close tonight so hmm..), besides this sleep debt thing, also 
resulting in a pretty bad diet and leading to overall unsightly fat gains lol.
