It's been two years since 
my last blog entry. 

I always wanted this blog to be like a journal into my life but it has not 
been very well-organised. 
Although as I spend sometime reading back the entries, it did triggered some 
pleasant memories of years ago. 

Well, two years has been a long time. Since 2010, quite a fair bit has 
changed. Perhaps a fair bit is an understatement, and live changing is more 
appropriate. 

In 2010, I proposed to my girlfriend in Shanghai at the World Expo 2010. We 
made it to the news too. I started a new appointment in the Force, where a new 
job scope and experience awaits. I learned new skillsets and also had thankful 
opportunities to visit the United States and London through work. 

In 2011, we got married and for our honeymoon, we took the chance to visit 
Spain and Italy, where I could use little smatterings of Spanish to converse. 
I started looking for other career opportunities but having a 3 months notice 
was difficult. I tried applying for business school, did pretty well on my 
GMAT score, but failed to make the cut for the interview. I will probably talk 
about that sometime later. I started visiting the gym again with Gabriel. We 
trained for a good 10 months, before stopping again. 

In 2012, we learned to live together and marriage is a lifelong journey as we 
learn new things about each other. I am thankful that we are similar and that 
we can tolerate each other quirks, most of the time. I quit my job with the 
Air Force in pursuit of other interests. The work there had became uninspiring 
for me and I needed to rejuvenate myself. 

And that brings us to October. 

What will the future bring? Perhaps the state of joblessness draws out the mid 
life crisis emotions but despite that, I feel that the last couple of months 
has been a good break for me to think about what I really want to do and 
making the best use of the opportunities that had been presented. I am 
thankful for the options that appeared and I hope that in a couple of years 
time, life would be even more exciting.
