My boss brought up a good point today. If I’m indeed due to move, I really 
should make full use of my time in my current position to learn as much as 
possible as I will never have this opportunity again. It also continued to be 
a somewhat grooming session, with him giving pointers on how to handle my 
future appointment. We talked about how to handle your bosses, the 
expectations of how to be a good staff writer, what are the important things 
to focus on, and how working harder at the onset can result in less work in 
the future. It was indeed a very useful discussion throughout. Hmm… not 
sure how come he suddenly spoke to me with regards to this though, as I should 
not be due to move so soon. Perhaps some changes have happened recently. 
Anyway, back to the first pointer, what else should I concentrate on learning? 
I have definitely worked less hard this year, so this talk with my boss was 
rather apt for myself to refocus. Sigh.. while the future posting might result 
in more regular hours, I must admit that life here has stabilised and while we 
need to put out certain fires from time to time, it is still quite fun to work 
here, especially with the easy access / people around to support you.
