First day in Utah and it was a 
long one. I woke up early in the morning and took a stroll round the base. 
Amazed at the facilities they have inside, from a cinema, to fast food, to 
petrol station, 24 hr minimart and more.. It was pretty cold in the morning 
and my jacket finally came in handy but still regret bringing it along, as it 
only takes up precious luggage space! 
  Subsequently after, we met up with Francis and his family 
and he brought us to Salt Lake City for Dim Sum brunch and it was actually 
even better than the ones I get in Singapore, haha... it was pretty authentic 
tasting and well worth its price with the 6 of us  paying ard 50-60 USD. It 
was the standard dim sum fare with siew mai, carrot cake, pau, etc etc. The 
place was ran by Hongkongers which pretty much explain for the authencity of 
the dishes. And that was that for breakfast and 
we set off to a day of shopping at Tanger Outlet Center, Park City, Utah. It 
was just like any other mall, prices were definitely cheaper and I managed to 
get the stuff I wanted so that was a good thing. The one thing I enjoyed so 
far is really the service quality in US. It is so much better than Singapore, 
perhaps the people are more friendly and I know the sales assistants are in a 
way, expected to behave as such but it doesn't come across as overly forced. 
So after one afternoon of 
shopping, we headed back to Salt Lake City and straight to Salt Lake Capitol, 
which provided a magnificent view of the entire city. It was very grand and 
one could easy identify why the location was chosen as the State Building. The 
interior was also very nice and we spend some time just walking around and 
marvelling at the architecture construct.Temple 
Square was next and while I am not familiar with the whole Mormon / Christian 
thing, there was a strong religious influence in Salt Lake or Utah in general 
and this place just reinforces it. As above, it was architecturally very grand 
and it would be quite cool to listen to one of the choir performances in the 
various halls as they were all very proud of the acoustic modelling of the 
place. 
Dinner was at an Italian Restaurant, authentic and delicious. That sorta close 
the chapter on the touring of Utah as the next couple of days would be just 
work. On the last day, we had a 6 hour transit over at San Francisco and we 
took the train down to the famous Fisherman Wharf and took in the sights of 
the city. San Francisco looked way much more fun than Utah, haha. 

It was a great trip. I learnt alot, both work and otherwise. Work trips are 
the best, a break away from work without consuming any leave :).
