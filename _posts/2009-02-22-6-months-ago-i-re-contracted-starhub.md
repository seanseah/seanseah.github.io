6 months ago, I re-contracted 
Starhub for the [HP Mini-note 
2133](http://geek-looking-glass.blogspot.com/2008/07/i-just-want-to-find-sometime-to-leave.html), 
at that time, I already had the intentions to get a netbook and was seriously 
considering the many iterations of the eeePC. The Mini 2133 then was really 
quite crappy, with a slow processor, overheating problems and poor battery 
life. With all this things going against it, I quickly sold it for $710. Only 
recently, Starhub started to offer the newer model, the mini 1000 as part of 
their recontract goodies and that got me interested. I sourced for one of them 
through the HWZ forums and found a buyer selling it for guess what, $710 too.

The mini 1000 is much better than the older 2133. It is lighter, faster and 
comes with an internal 3G modem, allowing me to put to good use my free 3G sim 
card from Starhub. Evidence of the portability was tried and tested today as I 
connected to the net from various places in Singapore. I was supposed to help 
the gf with her flight check in details but totally forgot about it till I 
received a reminder sms and thanks to the new netbook, was able to settle the 
flight arrangements when outside. Of course, not everything is perfect. The 
mini 1000 does not have a great battery life, clocking in ard 2-3 hrs but that 
should be sufficient for short bouts. 

Oh well, just the usual dosage of geekiness...
