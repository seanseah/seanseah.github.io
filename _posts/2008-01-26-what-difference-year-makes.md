2008. A brand new year yet... 

A few baggages from last year has rolled 
over to continue bugging me. My leg injury hasn't fully recovered and my knee 
still acts up once in a while. Really can feel the body slowing down in terms 
of healing itself, and perhaps, never able to fully recover either. Well, it 
is still not all gloomy, I can still run / jog / skate / cycle just that quite 
often, after the activity, it will start to ache. gah. Long term injuries, 
those reports on soccer players tearing ligaments and what not, never seem 
possible to occur to us, till now. Perhaps age is indeed catching up. 

Car issues. My parallel importer has well, since declared bankrupt and I have 
already made a 10k deposit with them. The car doesn't seem to be arriving soon 
and the company is currently playing punk with details. Can't make it a police 
case, because its just a civil and not a criminal one, though the way they 
handle it, it kinda borders as such. Seeking respite from CASE and other legal 
advice have not really been exactly helpful and the only course of action it 
appears now is to wait out the 6 month contractual obligation. Gah. 

Luckily, my dad doesn't use his car so often, so been driving his car the past 
couple of weeks to work, and it's irritating as well, driving across the 
island to and fro. Just have to suck it and be an obedient soldier in this 
aspect.
