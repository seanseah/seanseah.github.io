I have been hearing quite a bit about this place, Villa Bali, from friends and blogs, so I finally went to see what it's all about. The location is really quite out of the way, opposite Alexandra Retail Centre, and not a place that one can just happen upon.

The place has a nice feel to it with very rustic architecture, impressing visitors with its transformation from the city-esque lifestyle we are so used to. To enter, we had to cross an old bridge of sorts, which was symbolic of a portal or gateway and fit the image it tries to create quite nicely.

The impression the place leaves me with is reminiscent of Krabi. It has that wonderful laid-back lifestyle and similar decorations. Even the incense and mosquito coil smell was alike! It reminds me of how we can go out for drinks at night and just laze by the beach. There were raised platforms where people could sit or lie down, along with a small kerosene lamp to guide us through the menus. It makes me want to go on holiday again, seeking an idyllic couple of days.

We explored both the interior and exterior areas, which had quite a significant difference. The interior resembled a normal pub atmosphere and felt a little more formal. I preferred the outdoor seating with its breeze and more relaxed environment.

I went with J and my university friends. I hope it wasn't too awkward for J. My university friends are important to me, they are the group of friends who supported me throughout my university days, making it enjoyable. Countless study sessions were spent with them at either YIH or the Central Library.

We first met up at Vivo, where we stumbled upon CNY decorations and took photos with our zodiac signs. It's another 12-year cycle by next year! Iâ€™ll be turning 24 soon. Will the Year of the Rat be good?

Hmmm.
