Have been hearing quite a bit about this place, Villa Bali, either 
from friends or blogs so finally went to see what its all about. The location 
is really quite out of the way, opposite Alexandra Point and not a place that 
one can just happen to stumble upon. 

The place has a nice feel to it, very rustic architecture and it impresses one 
with the transformation from the city-esque lifestyle we are so used to. Even 
just to enter, we had to cross an old bridge of sorts and it was symbolic of a 
portal or gateway and fits the image it tries to create quite nicely. 

The impression the place leaves me is of Krabi? It has that wonderful laid 
back lifestyle and so similar decorations. Even the incense / mosquito coil 
smell was similar! It just reminds me of how we can go out for drinks at night 
and just laze by the beach. There were raised platforms where people can sit, 
lie down and a small kerozene lamp to guide you through the menus. It makes me 
want to go on holiday again, seeking for an idyllic couple of days. Anyway, we 
went to both the interior and exterior areas. Quite a significant difference 
actually - the interior is pretty much like a normal pub atmosphere and a 
little more formal. Preferred the outdoors seating, the outdoor breeze, the 
more chill-out relaxed environment. 

Went with J and my Uni friends. I hope it wasn't too awkward for J. But as 
always, the enjoyment was due to the company - the group of friends who 
supported me through out my university days - making it enjoyable. Countless 
study sessions were spent with them, dwelling at either YIH or the Central 
Library. 

We first met up at Vivo, where we stumbled 
upon CNY decorations, and took photos with our zodiac signs. Its another 12 
year cycle by next year! Going to be 24 soon. Will the year of the Rat be 
good? 

hmmm.
