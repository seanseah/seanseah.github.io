On leave 
for this 3 days, caught two movies today with jiali. The Simpsons and a 
premiere for a British film.. Cashback. Ok 2 movies in one day is really quite 
tiring, although both shows were quite interesting, simpsons for its own 
stupid brand of humour and hey, its one of my favourite cartoons by far. 
Didn't had any idea what cashback was about and subsequently after the movie, 
still have no idea what relevance the title has to the story but hmm, it was a 
light hearted movie with individual scenes that were hilariously funny.  

A day leave well spent =)
