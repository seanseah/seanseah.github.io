We went for dinner at Kim Choo’s Kitchen, a peranakan place at Katong. The 
very local cuisine was meant to re-introduce my tastebuds back to food here 
after a week of being overseas. It was our first time there, and it looks 
pretty authentic, with the traditional Nyonya decor and what look like 
antiques there. la comida es deliciosa (the food is delicious)… 
although it was a tad saltish. ![](http://lh4.ggpht.com/_m5e8Pqc8k3c/SdE7QvCoDTI/AAAAAAAAFvU/kRqAg_QGWg0/s1600/DSCF5765%5B11%5D.jpg)

 We had stewed pork, chicken buah kelak, assam pedas and all relatively 
big portions for 2. The assam pedas reminded me of the one we had at Changi 
Shore restaurant, but for a fraction of the cost. I shall attempt to bring my 
grandma here for dinner soon. Also, there’s no GST or service charge, so 
that’s a good 17% discount already. Hmm… shall try to bring my grandma here 
for dinner soon. Anyway, need to find an alternative for parking, my usual 
place beside Katong Mall has raised its rate and was annoyed to see that they 
don’t even have any grace period. zzz… I have been up since 1am. Gah, I 
slept from ard 1030 till 1 so I did get some rest but I can’t seem to sleep 
back. I am starting to feel sleepy now but I am suppose to go to work, sheesh.
