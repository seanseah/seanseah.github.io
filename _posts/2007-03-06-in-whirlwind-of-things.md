Wow, I have 
actually been doing work quite regularly, a surprise... and yet still, none 
for FYP, but I guess that will change once the test is over. 

Its been 3 tests in 3 days, almost like the Year 1s exam rush, haven't really 
had a similar tight schedule since then. It ain't all that bad though, still 
got 1 that's on S/U or 2, if you count the insurance exam!

M9 - Insurance

At least, it wasn't all for naught, lucky to 
pass! With this, I am sort of clearer on the insurance aspects and coverage 
required and I guess it does put me in a better state to handle and better 
choose the upcoming policies that I would be buying lol. I can even be an 
insurance agent next time, but nah, it's definitely one of the lowest on the 
job list. 

To be honest, I never really liked insurance, and insurance agents even 
lesser, always heard too many bad things about it, and that other form of 
investment are better. Even today's New Paper (I know not the best source of 
information) was evaluating the performances of various unit trusts and 
investment-linked insurances and it turned out that 55% and potentially more 
(basic charges not included) were underperforming so it isn't exactly an ideal 
case. Yet, it does take much of the worry out from investments. 

So sad, my 4414 test didn't go to well, haha... guess could have studied a bit 
more but was distracted and probably tired after the whole insurance thing, 
but oh well, maybe the only thing about it is that doing well can impress 
Kunle, which I desperately need to do something about the whole FYP thing. Ok 
after all this has settled... Well last test tomorrow! Just need to see it 
through to close the chapter on NUS exams.
