All aboard! We were onboard the Sapphire Princess for a 4D3N cruise that would call at Klang (Kuala Lumpur) and George Town (Penang). The Sapphire was a marked difference to my other cruise experiences, which were limited to Star Cruises operated by Genting. On the scale of cruise lines, Princess can be considered as an upper-middle class brand and things were pretty nice. Especially the food. They had different themed dining rooms and food was served via a sit-down dining concept.

Food was pre-dominantly western / European influence, so for those with a heavy penchant for Asian cuisine would find options limited. They did cater to the local taste buds, as you would usually be able to find a local Asian-inspired dish offered on the menu as an alternative. However, the quality of the dish often paled when compared to others on the menu. They probably still need a few more tries to perfect it. Personally, I enjoyed the food. You should try to go reserve a table as early as possible, **even breakfast**, and to also explore the various dining rooms available, with names such as the Vivaldi, the Santa Fe, etc, all with their own themed decorations. The sit down fine dining does not limit how much you can eat. For the matter, if you can stomach two main courses, go ahead to order it. Or if the appetiser was so yummilious, go ahead to order one more! It's your own dining experience, so make your own rules.

The unique feature on the Sapphire Princess would be the Movies under the Stars where the top deck of the ship is converted to an open air theatre, with popcorn and drinks available for a relaxing and enjoyable experience. It's really quite relaxing to laze on a deck chair with the sea breeze, a drink in hand, and enjoying a movie.

We didn't disembark at Klang - instead we chose to remain onboard the ship. Not a bad choice as that gave us time to roam about the ship, use the pool, gym, enjoy a British-style pub lunch, lounge by the pool, followed by high tea. It was sinful enjoyment. If you get off at Klang, it would be better to get one of the shore excursions as the terminal is really far from the city. Otherwise, the nearest place which you can take a taxi too is the AEON Bukit Tinggi Shopping Centre (Jusco Bukit Tinggi). It is the largest shopping mall in Klang, which should be a comfortable way to spend a few hours.

We did stop at George Town, Penang though. George Town boasts a European-style esplanade and a wealth of temples, mosques and Chinese clan houses. Listed as a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site in 2008, this virgin paradise has no shortage of cultural sights and natural scenery. We didn't venture far, just took a cab out to the near city area and did a standard walking tour. We took the opportunity to check out the unique street art of painted wall murals or unique iron caricatures that lined the streets, bringing to life scenes fit for a history textbook.

Cruises aren't really my style as I travel to see the world and for different experiences. Unless the port of calls are unique, there isn't much adventure from a traveler's perspective. However, cruises are an easy getaway, with never a moment of boredom thanks to the well-planned activities and entertainment options available on deck. It's definitely less stressful and enjoyable if you travel in big groups or families.
