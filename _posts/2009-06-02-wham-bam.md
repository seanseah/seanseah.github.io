 =(  Memories of cruising down a small lane and just one more 
turn before I actually reach home when all of a sudden, wham! One loud 
sickening crunch filling my ears and a gloomy feeling started to settle in. It 
was a school bus and it had rammed into my side. Sheesh… Anyway, it was 
thankful that I was not hurt but the car is now stuck in a workshop awaiting 
repairs. If everything goes well, the claim against the bus should hopefully 
proceed smoothly and I will get my car back in 9 days time. It has been a bad 
year driving… Oh well, here’s hoping that the days ahead will improve.
