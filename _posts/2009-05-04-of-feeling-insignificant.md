The world 
revolves and goes on, and our little lifes mean zilch. So what is it that 
matters for us?It has been a happening few months,the global financial crisis hit 
the world badly in late 2008 and the world has not really recovered since. 
Stock prices have plummeted, banks are in trouble and many more bad news to 
come I suspect. Recently, the poor pig got implicated as well with the H1N1 
flu virus making its rounds in Mexico and America, and have started 
threatening to hit our regions as well. The frenzy that has been stirred is a 
little over excessive, considering that the virus is actually not that potent 
compared to say the avian flu.Yet, bad times do mean for gems and opportunities to seize but it 
really is all about finding the right one. A right investment, a right 
purchase could make all the difference in the next few years or even decades. 
Hence, is there any purpose in working hard? Sense of achievement? 
Recognition? What is it about excelling in one's career besides the monetary 
rewards (which may not be much, I might add)? The importance of pride cannot 
be denied and to a certain extent, it matters to me, but when weighed in 
accordance with the effort needed, it doesn't make much sense. Guess I can't 
help sounding a little demoralised, but I will still continue to work hard, 
just that will be a bit more laid back when it comes to things. End of the 
day, its just work! :)
