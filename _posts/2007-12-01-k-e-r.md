The nickname that has stuck with me the 
longest, the one that i kept using, partially due to it actually being 
recognizable. It all probably started in secondary 3. A trip to JB proved 
fruitful with a game titled Unreal Tournament. The single player mode was 
heckuva fun but it all started when I ventured online. Like everybody else, i 
started off as a noob, getting owned all the time.

It didn't help that I was on a 56k modem 
connection too, yet it was good training to start tho, as it just really 
forced a more intelligent style of play and resulted in me playing much better 
later on. My favourite weapon then, the ASMD (which is an acronym for 
something crude) Shock Rifle which was more lag friendly. (its been 8 years 
and i still remb the name.. Haha). I was unable to aim well, what with the 1-2 
second lag, so the weapon suited high-pingers as its explosion radius was 
huge, yet a one trick monkey wasn't going too far, and I really only started 
improving much later on. 

There were clans then and when playing so 
often, it was easy to make friends. I formed a clan.. ngE with Weiyi, and it 
grew to a size of 5 lol.. And to commemorate the clan, what better way than to 
organise a clan match. I still remember then that X3M (a clan) members were 
very friendly and were very willing to play with other people, so we 
eventually organized a match with them... 

Which ended us losing..

(which btw stands for Neon Genesis 
Evangelion ... the Anime) 

*ngE didn't last long, we had too little 
people and well, it was a headache being a clan leader, so it got disbanded 
soon after the first game.. lol 

I was clanless then for awhile, and after 
sometime, was eventually recruited by X3M, giving rise to my gametag. They 
were a bunch of great people, and though I was very much a young boy compared 
to the rest of them, they still treated me very nicely. Guess socially, we all 
belong to rather different strata, which made it rather interesting. There was 
me, the 'good' boy, then there were some who weren't great academically and 
had dropped out of school, some were working, heck, there was one who was 
studying for a phd. 

Around that time, the first competition 
came up, SiliconHorizon UT99 and it was held at parklane. Hmm, think it was 
the first time I went there and also the first time meeting up with the rest 
of the clan mates. I was in X3M team 2 then, and we did perform rather 
admirably, getting booted out in the quarter finals, out of 32 teams. No 
prizes though, but the experience was definitely worth it.

That was also about the time where I 
finally switched to broadband, and that was one big difference to my gameplay. 
I started playing much better and became a big fan of 1v1s and started playing 
with alot of players, even with the top ranked UT player in Singapore, 
LightBringer, at that time, needless to say, got pwned rather badly. One of my 
closer friends in the game, Destiny[X3M] who later left the clan, had somewhat 
of a bad boy reputation and had lots of clashes with other players potentially 
due to his attitude. However, he was rather ok with me and he was also 
somewhat my part time coach, often getting me for training sessions. On a 
sidenote, he was a psle dropout, yet, he was excellent at web development / 
flash and well he did do some business from there which was admirable. His 
stories were all pretty interesting though... 

My nickname started to be recognised when I 
joined any multiplayer game. To an extent that when joining a game with my 
nickname would be added pressure and I only kept it for official games or 
where I wanted to be identified. It was also more fun when I joined with an 
unknown nickname and owned the game, resulting in various guesses to my 
identity. Instead of playing to win, I started trying to survive each round 
without dying, well, it goes like this... 

20 kills without dying - UNSTOPPABLE! 
25 kills -                          
GODLIKE!!! 

Those were the days indeed... heh...

There were a couple more tournaments after 
that, the Singapore Unreal Tournament League (SUTL) and then the SAFRA 
CyberExtreme Tournament which we both came in 2nd I think, no luck / skill in 
getting the coveted first. Though I would say both times were pretty close! 
Prizes weren't great compared to today's prizes but still very much welcomed 
for something that was enjoyable at the same time. 

The new version of Unreal Tournament came 
out soon after, and my computer wasn't able to support it and it wasn't 
enjoyable when everything moves in jerks. I stopped playing for awhile and 
with JC and what not, was distracted from the game. When I did finally 
upgraded my PC, I kinda lacked the drive to practice from scratch again and it 
was also hard to play catch up all over, so that well.. kinda marked the end 
of my online FPS gaming days =). 

It was fun while it lasted!!
