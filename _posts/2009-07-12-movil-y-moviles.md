The girlfriend lost her phone couple of weeks ago which resulted in a mad 
scramble around town to get a new sim card. It turned out more painful than I 
initially imagined. We were first at Anchorpoint when the loss was discovered. 
By then, the perpetuator had already turned off the phone. We could only 
deactivate it and went to get a new sim. We learned a lesson that only Hello! 
Shops can replace lost sim card, which brought us from Vivo to West Mall. 
Luckily, there wasn’t much of a queue at West Mall unlike the iPhone 3GS 
madness at Comcentre.  I recontracted my contract for the 32gb iPhone 
3GS, and subsequently sold it, which brought about the following calculation. 
 Based on current iOne (CIS) plan of $23.65 per mth (VAS included), the 
optimum contract was to go for the iFlexi as after factoring in the monthly 
price differences, I gain $400+ along with an extra 500mb data plan. 

|**Name** | **Price Plan** | **VAS** | **Phone** | **Difference** | **Profit** |
| ------- | -------------- | ------- | --------- | -------------- | ---------- |
|iOne w data** | $20.97 | $19.60 | $748.00 | $405.96 | $246.04 |
| iOne (non-CIS) | $25.68 | $4.68 | $848.00 | $161.07 | $390.93 |  
| iFlexi | $35.10 | $4.68 | $578.00 | $387.12 | $434.88 |

For my dad’s case however, it wasn’t so simple. Currently the classic plan 
is only $14.98 per month due to CIS rates. So instead of signing up for the 
data plan, I should forego the CIS rate and switch to the standard Classic 
plan for my dad as there might be loyalty discounts subsequently.  

| **Name** | **Price Plan** | **VAS** | **Phone** | **Difference** | **Profit** |
| -------- | -------------- | ------- | --------- | -------------- | ---------- |
| Classic (non-CIS) | $29.96 | $0.00 | $728.00 | $359.52 | $312.48  |
| iOne (non-CIS) | $25.68 | $4.68 | $848.00 | $369.15 | $182.85 |
| iFlexi | $35.10 | $4.68 | $578.00 | $595.20 | $226.80  |
| Classic (CIS) w data (24 mths) | $14.98 | $16.92 | $728.00 | $406.08 | $265.92
