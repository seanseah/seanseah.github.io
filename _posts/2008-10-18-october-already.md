The last month has been 
eventful to say the least. After coming back from USA, hardly had time to rest 
before I was running to and fro again, and the very same day back, had an 
accident when I dozed off on the roads. Thankfully, it was a mild one, but 
still slight damage to both cars. Lesson learnt :( 
 

Work has been a blur since I 
came back. I do have slightly better control of time, but deadlines come in 
droves and new things crop up all the time which has resulted in me being 
super stretched out. But to a certain extent, that's all over and done with, 
some events went well, some didn't, but all in all, I would say that this year 
has turned out quite well. I still suck at handling HR issues though.. and 
that is always a concern and challenge to understand them. It is an art that 
I'm painfully trying every day.
