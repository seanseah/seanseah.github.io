Yawnnnnnnnnn... 
A long day that brought me to Sembawang, 
Ubi, Hougang then back home.. yet pretty eventful! 

Yawnnnn... 
Slept late last night due to last minute 
packing of the clothes to bring for the upcoming chalet stay, and even then 
didn't finish packing... 

Yawnnn... 
Slept later due to one of the last few 
dota games that will soon stop upon commencement of course 

Yawn... 
Slept even later talking to jiali with 
time soon (and already) becoming a precious commodity. 


Thought I could report late for work, 
well, since its the last day and the big bosses are probably not around with a 
big function last night. As it turned out, I'm even much earlier than normal, 
and heck, not a single person in office lol... Some loose ends to wrap up and 
soon a new phase of my career is begining (or more like, the actual start of 
my career).
