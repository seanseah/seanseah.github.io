I took half a day leave today with the intention to sort out my road tax. 
As it turned out, I managed to sort it out even before I left office. I called 
up the company to check the status of my application and shortly, they were 
able to transfer the notice to LTA. With that completed, i was able to login 
and pay my road tax at my office, leaving me with a full half day free. 
Spent the time catching up with my JC friends, met up with Alan and Amos at 
Bugis and we ended up spending a whole day here. It was the first time i 
checked out Iluma, before we returned to bugis junction for teatime dessert 
and subsequently dinner. It was fun to catch up with them and also, thankful 
for having secured a job in this challenging times. They had just graduated 
and though I might not be having the most admired of job, it at least has 
grant me some stability and assurance in this times. Furthermore, with the new 
changes, who knows how it might be in a few years time? :)
