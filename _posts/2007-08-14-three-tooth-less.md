From a normal cleaning scheduled at my camp's dental clinic, led to 
being referred to Alexandra Hospital for a wisdom tooth operation, and to 
extract 3 at one go. T.T Aye, they weren't giving me problems (yet) but having 
seen how my old wisdom tooth had affected me, it was something that was better 
removed, especially now that I'm still free. Anyway, day of my operation went by smoothly, thanks to jiali 
keeping me company! I was in and out of the dentist chair in less than 15 
minutes, couple of jabs per tooth, a little sawing, some jerk and pull and all 
3 teeth were out. Much better than my previous wisdom tooth op, which took me 
almost an hour and seeing the dentist grinding away in your mouth is 
definitely not an experience worth repeating. Kept constantly thinking how 
great it was this time around and how much faster compared to previously.. 
haha.. but I guess, hmm, to give my previous dentist some credit, though he 
hardly deserve it, the previous case could have been more complicated... 

Oh well, besides the constant bleeding, 
swelling, pain in talking, chewing, it wasn't all that bad, get to stay at 
home and grind away on Lunia and the occasional DOTA games.. But gosh to those 
who say MC for wisdom tooth is shuang, and to say that actually don't need MC 
and fit to go back and work, I don't agree at all! I rather work, save my 400+ 
dollars, eat normally, talk normally, don't have to worry about bleeding, or 
stuffing sanitary pad-like gauze into your mouth to soak up the blood, or the 
sian-ness in eating porridge day after day. But its OVER! Oh well, the daily grinding of Lunia was quite 
fun, its an online MMORPG that does have a story, and individual quests, like 
Diablo, so just been at it everyday, and well, finally.. completed! (in a 
way). Not a bad game, haha.. and its free, so hey! 
 
 
 Oh well, in hoping that the tooth 
fairy does indeed exist and that she comes visiting once in awhile, I have 
three new tooth to add to my collection, which shouldn't be increasing in the 
near future! 
More importantly I guess, is the feeling that at least one more problem less 
to worry about. Hmm, and that they will not be around to cause any more 
undesired pain... Can't wait to being able to eat normally once again!
