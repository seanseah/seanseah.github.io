Wow what a start to a first day at work. Noisy fan and warm sticky 
weather along with lots of phelgm, argh, kept me up at night. Woke at hmm 615 
and grab a quick breakfast before heading out to catch my bus. Wah left house 
at 630 approx and reached work at hmm, almost 8??!! 
Haha.. Ran into some bus problem as me and 
Andy took the A version of the bus and it did not go the entire route which 
was meant to be a loop so we had to wait for the next bus. Hmm, orientation 
followed and got to meet the people i will be working with and all is well and 
good as we bumbled around doing the required admin stuff.Had a meeting with the big boss and direct boss 
and was assigned my project and stuff, lots of weird terms coming up and had 
to half guess what they were. Felt sort of inadequated by my degree, lack of 
aeronautical knowledge coupled with no specialisation except in microE which 
is totally useless here! Hmm but ok the project does still sound do-able and 
interesting at least so still happy with it!Well the meeting resulted in me being late for teabreak, a total of 
hmm 10 of us were there? Wee.. Haha, had a taste of the rubbery prata which 
seems like it is going to be my staple very soon, ahh.. can't be helped, seems 
like other alternative not very good also, with prata being the better 
one.First actual use of results! Faxed in 
the NUS copy, hope can get higher pay ASAP! Oh, it was also more shuang to 
finally write, Education Status: Bachelor Degree (1st Class Hons) Electrical 
Engineering. Wahaha. Can't possibly slack for too long so went back to office. 
Oh got a cubicle but no comp, but no comp means can't do work also! Guy in 
charge of me passed me some stuff to read, at least got things to do, but 
really felt like crying when start to read lo, haha damn boring! Stoned around till lunch. At least lunch 
everyday is provided so shall not be too picky about the food, cos going to 
have to eat it for at least 9 months. Oh slightly before, had a piece of good 
news. Ivy got her job! Haha... so happy for her, finally all those time spent 
taking those horrible EE44xx modules with her are not wasted. If she didn't 
get a semicon job.. AH!!!! Haha.. Had a momentary run in with one of the encik 
during lunch, oo, really being lowest life ard is no no fun! Oh well, faster 
left the area and back to more normal working environment, but a minor stop 
first for some retail therapy!Followed my 
in charge to Sembawang, and was there till around 5:30pm. Ahh, official 
working hours... It wasn't too bad, quite interesting but the cough was acting 
up and during the presentation, wanted to cough so badly, but had to keep 
stifling it, haha, could feel tears welling up in my eyes. Oh met another 
graduate there, so wasn't too bad also, at least had abit more company other 
than my supervisor. Hmm.. ahh.. really tiring first day, being sick doesn't 
help =( 

ook, really looking forward to thursday (Vesak Day).. ahh already have the 
weekend mentality, oh no. so fast. haha. wee.. 2 more days to end of the 
"week"!
