It's August the 9th, 2015 - a day to mark 50 years of our nation's independence. The whole country was abuzz with patriotism and covered in red / white motifs as the SG50 celebration was in full flow. Yet, there's a wedding to attend. I was decked in a light gray suit, engaged in groomsman duties for friends (both the bride and groom were my classmates) that I've known for over 15 years.

As we get older, weddings are opportunities for us to catch up with friends. Unfortunately, all of us are individually caught up with our own lives that we rarely have time to meet up. Old friends get along so easily, as we understand the nuances of each other, and the conversation easily flows and we can easily jump into the latest happenings of each other's life. As the night winds down, I can feel the tiredness set in. No longer bestowed with a young, agile body, it is even more evident that I need to start exercising more.

It's been a happy day.

15 years ago, when we were all seated in the same class, none of us would have guessed that six of us would eventually find their soulmates in one another. Today, the last couple has taken the step forward to start forth their new chapter of marriage life.

As the night winds down, I started to reflect. For myself, it has been over three years since I took the same marriage step with J, and as I looked back on the initial fears and trepidations, all of that were unfounded. I can confidently say that I have never loved J more in my life, and the journey as a marriage pair has brought us closer. Love as much as you can, as love is limitless. Our journey may not have been easy, but when we faced these challenges as a couple, we gained strength from each other.
