Amidst preparation for FYP and recovering from a mild hangover, I can't missed out on celebrating our one month anniversary or 1st Monthsary.

On the hangover bit, we had started the celebrations a little earlier with friends the night before at St James. This is my first ever visit to St James. (Yes! I'm a newbie.) The alcohol was showing its effect on my stomach and didnâ€™t agree with whatever else I introduced since the morning. Irritating but bearable. It just meant I had to eat a little less. On a positive note, it helps cut down on my calorie intake after the long night out.

We already had all the noise and fun the night before, plus I was still feeling quite lousy what with my stomach and the overall tiredness, so we ended up having something light. We went back to the place where we got together 1 month ago, Delifrance @ Anchorpoint, it's never going to be the same again. She got me such a cute present, the DHS Alumni doll, so symbolic of us in such a way, and a story book that chronicles our well, first moments :). Time really flies, doesn't it, it really emphasize how much we need to seize the moment.

Slightly prior to that, we also celebrated a first of sorts - I first bought her flowers on 21st January 2007 - The Day of Your Driving Test. *While it took her a couple more years and many more tries before she passed, she persevered. Testament to her indomitable spirit.*

It was a bouquet of lilies and roses. White lilies are symbolic with purity, virginity, majesty, which were her favourite. A rose by any other name would smell as sweet. Yet, roses are like synonymous with love, and even the number of stalks have meanings. Commercialised? Maybe. Yet even for a fleeting moment, flowers in bloom are still so beautiful - and just to bring a smile to your face, is all worth it.

Looking forward to many more months and years together!
