Haha.. very American diner like, even to the detail of not having chili sauce on the table (only ketchup and mustard).. had to specially request for a bottle haha.. Food was good, me being the burger fan, was quite pleased with it! Oh, Reuben, Chong, some other guy + their families were sitting behind us, they are doing the same job as me, albeit 6 years older, and the crossroads of leaving/staying in the organisation. Wah, still so on to meet up for dinner and maybe a few years down the road, I will be in their shoes! Didn't really get to eavesdrop on their conversation but at the start heard some engineering comment, gosh.. that was abit extreme.<figure><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_m5e8Pqc8k3c/Rwir5fRkdfI/AAAAAAAADTk/iE6hPTKSuKQ/s1600-h/deli.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" style="font-family: verdana;"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_m5e8Pqc8k3c/Rwir5fRkdfI/AAAAAAAADTk/iE6hPTKSuKQ/s800/deli.jpg" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5118529980642653682" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center;" /></a></figure>Anyway, after dinner went to watch "The Campaign to confer the Public Service Star on JBJ". A political satire about that JBJ, a fictitious figure instead of the real one, but yet, it was still a tongue in cheek way of poking fun at how Singaporeans are still very much afraid of getting involved with the opposition. It was a good play, with the 2nd half being more serious and much better, yet, felt the plot was abit weak at times due to the links between acts perhaps a tad weak. Guess the interesting part was seeing how the old and new civil service contrast, and bringing in the media, the law and how the fear of each other as well as the countless red tapes was apt considering that I'm part of the system as well.<figure><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_m5e8Pqc8k3c/RwirxvRkdeI/AAAAAAAADTc/_N3qiXnPows/s1600-h/JBJ1.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" style="font-family: verdana;"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_m5e8Pqc8k3c/RwirxvRkdeI/AAAAAAAADTc/_N3qiXnPows/s800/JBJ1.jpg" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5118529847498667490" style="cursor: pointer; display: block; margin: 0px auto 10px; text-align: center;" /></a></figure>Anyway, something was wrong with the air conditioning of the place, became very fidgety as it was rather stuffy and wasn't really able to concentrate on the show too! Or maybe hmm, just not used to sitting down for long.. hoho.. Oh well, end of the month, another concert, but that one doesn't involve sitting, holy wars, here I come =)
