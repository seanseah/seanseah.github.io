Went to Seah Street Deli for dinner last night.. my surname leh, must support. 
Haha.. very American diner like, even to the detail of not having chili sauce 
on the table (only ketchup and mustard).. had to specially request for a bottle. 
(_Update: 2015 - it has since closed though!_). Food was good, me being the burger 
fan, was quite pleased with it! Oh, Reuben, Chong, some other guy + their families 
were sitting behind us, they are my career seniors, albeit 6 years older, and the 
crossroads of leaving/staying in the organisation. Wah, still so on to meet up for 
dinner and maybe a few years down the road, I will be in their shoes! Didn't really 
get to eavesdrop on their conversation though!

Anyway, after dinner went to watch "The Campaign to confer the Public Service 
Star on JBJ". A political satire about that JBJ, a fictitious figure instead of 
the real one, but yet, it was still a tongue in cheek way of poking fun at how 
Singaporeans are still very much afraid of getting involved with the opposition. 
It was a good play, with the 2nd half being more serious and much better, yet, 
felt the plot was abit weak at times due to the links between acts perhaps a tad 
weak. Guess the interesting part was seeing how the old and new civil service 
contrast, and bringing in the media, the law and how the fear of each other as 
well as the countless red tapes was apt considering that I'm part of the system as well.

Anyway, something was wrong with the air conditioning of the place, became very 
fidgety as it was rather stuffy and wasn't really able to concentrate on the show 
too! Or maybe hmm, just not used to sitting down for long.. hoho.. Oh well, end 
of the month, another concert, but that one doesn't involve sitting, holy wars, here I come =)
