This came in the mail today, in an unassuming looking envelope. ![](http://lh6.ggpht.com/_m5e8Pqc8k3c/SeYj75VEctI/AAAAAAAAFv8/L51BpIETuxE/s1600/DSCF5791%5B2%5D.jpg) 
I got it from eBay, won an auction for a 16GB SDHC Class 6 card for USD 
$14.06. Cheap! Comparatively, Singapore prices were around SGD$25 for an 8GB 
equivalent card. It is however not branded and no warranty coverage, but don’t 
think such memory cards can spoil that easily. Anyway, the SD Card is going 
into my Netbook and staying there. I have been shopping for quite a few things 
online recently, and still waiting for 2 more big packages from Dealextreme 
and Focalprice to come.. can’t wait!
