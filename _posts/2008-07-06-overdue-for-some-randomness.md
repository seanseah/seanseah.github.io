Time really flies especially when one is busy. So much so that many 
things are just left undone. Twinkle of an eye and I am already 24, sheesh. I 
thought the holiday month could give me some time to rest but work and the 
stress level is still quite high. 

Heh, overall geekiness was maintained 
throughout the course of this month thanks to a few bonus-es from the Telcos. 
Well, firstly recontracted Starhub Cable which for the 24 month contract, 
comes with a free HP Mini notebook, though not collected yet, should be quite 
fun to mess around. I probably intend to sell it tho, so if anybody is 
interested do let me know :). The other thing it came with was a Data Sim 
card, which allows me to surf for free via 3G. Hmm, useful but the hassle is 
in swapping sim cards, which resulted in me searching for another 3G phone or 
a 3G modem to use on-the-go. 

This was where Singtel came in handy, with 
the relaunch of their online SingTelShop, it came along with a blooper. A 0 
dollars 24 month contract. Thanks to my unexplainable obsession with EDMW, I 
got the contract at almost the last instance before they took it offline. 
Singtel honoured their mistake and hey, a free 24 month phone contract + 
Samsung U700 for me, at no costs at all :) Putting in the starhub sim, this 
phone works well as a a on the go web browser, screen is definitely not as 
good as my E61 though. However, my dad is eyeing the phone to replace the junk 
that I got for him last year, oh well, shall hold on to it a little longer 
before passing over to him.

3rd night shift, and 4 more days to my first official leave / break from work. 
Looking forward to it! Work is piling up yet again, and motivation to clear it 
is really quite low, somehow, more and more just seems to pile up. Oh well, 
shall give myself this break to recharge and hopefully come back with the 
energy to do so! (ya right, probably be just extremely tired when I'm back) 

I'm always a procrastinator, in alot that 
I do. Perhaps its just being wishy-washy but never really dared to commit to 
something even though I might have spent quite abit of time thinking about it 
and just unwilling to take the final step to see it through. And it shows. In 
the way I work, in the things that I want to buy, sometimes I thought it could 
be more of being prudent and not willing to spend, yet, perhaps it really is 
more of just not willing to set my decision firm. Hmm... food for thought. 
It's really something I should change and improve, not good to spend too much 
time thinking, time is never enough :)
