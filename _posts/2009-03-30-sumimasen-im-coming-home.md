I am currently onboard the flight back to Singapore, its been a long 
journey back and really, can’t wait to be home. It was a good trip, but 
somehow, not as good as I expected, guess I was hoping it to be more like a 
holiday but we didn’t sightsee much. It was a nice break from work still, not 
needing to think about the daily niggling affairs, but still, I have my own 
work left undone which I desperately need to follow up when I return to 
office. Ah well… end of the day, when travelling with your boss, it is not as 
relaxed as I hope / want it to be.  Anyway, Chicago Airport is a mess, 
the directions are bad and we ended up running around trying to find the 
check-in counter for ANA, and we move back and forth in the terminal trying to 
find our way.. sheesh lol, 3 clowns running abt in the terminal as we didnt 
had much time. It was coupled with the fact that even the Airport staff had no 
clue where was the ANA counter, and some confused it with JAL, and ended up 
giving us conflicting directions. Well, it all ended well and we still managed 
to check out the lounges both at Chicago and Narita. It definitely is fun to 
be awarded Gold membership for frequent fliers, milking the priority queues 
for both the security and boarding. 4 hours more to touchdown. ANA 
flight thus far have been great, except for a minor glitch for the inflight 
entertainment system resulting in me having the time to type this. Heh… 
anyway, seems that the service have recovered and time for me to catch my fix 
of 24, onto episode 12 now.
