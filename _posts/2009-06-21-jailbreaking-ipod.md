What a quick week it has been... Spanish lesson this week was quite tough with 
part of the reason being not prepared with the homework. Had loads of 
vocabulary shoved to us this week but with only a weekly revision, it's going 
to be a challenge to remember all of them. 

Shall try to devote at least 30 minutes a day to focus on Spanish revolution 
else I'm never going to progress much faster.
