Hmm.. haha, **just** couldn't find the drive to go school today. 

First, I got ready for school, bathe, 
change, checked iris even and still a bit tentative of going. At the door, was 
still holding back somewhat and finally sms-ed to check whether my friends 
were there and yup, they were, so off I go. 

Second, at the bus stop, haha, can't stop 
thinking about how productive and how much time I will waste in school. About 
the lack of food, and about THE food. No motivation at all today! Exams on 
Monday, haven't seen a past year paper, hmm, what's this!? Haha... think I 
really study less and less every sem since can't remember when. Guess I am at 
my limits. 

Oh well, actually quite happy, so I decided to stay home today. Anyway, since 
I wasn't going to school, I went to POSB to clear up my bank stuff and that's 
a good thing since I needed to get my finances in order, next month going to 
be expensive with the trips, things to buy, after exams celebration. Gosh. 

Hmm, money, finance, another topic close 
to heart. Haha, maybe will blog more about it later.
