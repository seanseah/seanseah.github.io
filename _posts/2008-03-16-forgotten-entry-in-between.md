Finally able to take a breather, as the 
joys of commissioning dies down and as the administration + logistics of the 
event comes to a close. Amidst the downloading of photos from others as well 
as browsing my own set of photos, I came across the photos of recent events 
such as RCGC/RGDI, the airshow which breezed through as part of the entire 
joint term. 

... Singapore Airshow 20/02/2008 
![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_m5e8Pqc8k3c/R95G4SvbN_I/AAAAAAAADpo/ZIEzlzKjWLQ/s1600/sa08-01.jpg)... a few of us in front of the apache ...  I was able to steal time off during the joint 
term period to attend the Singapore Airshow 08 and it was a much welcomed 
rest. A break from the mundane nature of the course, to evade queries and to 
put down some responsibility was wonderful, though I was still constantly 
being bugged on the phone but being physically away and detached from the mess 
did definitely help. Furthermore, the drive behind becoming an AEO, as to why 
I sign on, is more towards the interest towards technology and being able to 
view the exhibits, the various countries' aircraft was interesting.

 The aerial acrobatics display was nice, 
though ended up being sunburnt for staying in the outdoors for too long. It 
was the rare sun that accompanied us throughout the commissioning parade 
rehearsal period as overcast skies and dark clouds were much more common 
during the weeks. Well, it was also a goodie bag grab, but mainly ended up 
with stuff from the RSAF booth, the other booths were more interested in 
attending to customers and guess we don't really make the cut yet. 

... Graduation Pt 
II 07/03/2008 
It's almost a year since the NUS graduation and I get to relive it again, 
well, almost. 

![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_m5e8Pqc8k3c/R95MtivbOBI/AAAAAAAADp4/KLlgtO0S5GI/s1600/dining+in.JPG)Once again, the greater joy derived from here was 
the fact that it was two days of non parade rehearsal, and was one of the many 
milestones that I had set to see myself through the otherwise endless weeks. 
The occasion was fun too. My family didn't come so we just entertained 
ourselves by taking photos. It was fun looking like a penguin, at least all of 
us looked equally dorky... 

Guess the highlight of the event was in being adorned with the Air Logistics 
brevet, to decorate our otherwise plain uniform and the collection of our own 
sword. All this just means the day of being on-course is going to be over soon 
and real work awaits us. It's been a really good life (sort of) to be 
constantly on training but oh well, time for it to come to an end too. There 
were some mistakes with the engraving though, so currently still waiting for 
it to sort itself out. Sword cases are really expensive! Must be all the 
manufacturers milking the many officers-to-be... I'm still undecided on how I 
should go about displaying the sword or just keeping it inside the cupboard.
