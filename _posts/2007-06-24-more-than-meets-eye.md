Lazy Sunday morning, the usual tired but 
can't sleep, so went around finding things to read,  had heard some stuff with 
regards to Fate/Stay Night, so was reading up the Wikipedias and other links, 
hmm not bad, there was a subplot hidden within the anime and it was quite 
interesting to read it now and thinking of the hints that were dropped in the 
show. The anime was evolved from a Hentai game and wow, reading up the Wiki on 
it made me impressed that a sex game actually have multiple story arcs (3), 
and each of them uniquely different from one another to be interesting on its 
own, without the sex element coming into play. The story that got me 
interested was about time paradoxes which is seemingly popping up everywhere, 
be in Heroes, Time Traveller's Wife, End of Eternity and even an anime such as 
this. Guess many of us are not satisfied with the present to warrant a wish to 
step into the past, to modify what was once there, or to determine the 
future... 

From there, with the Transformers movie 
coming, went on to read about Transformers through wiki as well. Well, a 
little nostalgia tends to set in as rows of the new movie memorabilia/toys 
start to line up the shelves. It was like, the best cartoon then! and erm.. 
ever! Launched on 1984, the year that we were born, it had like 3 or 4 
seasons, a movie, tons of toys.. which were really the best, haha. There were 
subsequent stories or spin offs, beast wars, 2000, and all the Japanese 
versions but the original season was definitely the best. My favourite 
character.. Optimus Prime, a bit boring la, being the Autobot leader and all, 
but erm, still the most cool / composed / zai / best looking!

... 21st Century Look ... 

Still prefer the old chunky robot version 
as opposed to the more organic looking prime now. Even the classic generation 
1  toy still bear close similarity to the cartoon version, but the recent 
Takara release really looks the best. Well, the movie version of Prime doesn't 
look all that bad, at least still recognisable as perhaps compared to 
megatron, who's ermm, totally different? A new interpretation of the classic 
cartoon, still a must watch to relive some of the childhood memories. 

Autobots, transform.. and roll out!

I want to time travel, back to my 
childhood, revisiting the moments, reliving them...
