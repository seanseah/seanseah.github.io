Only two days have passed since I have left the student realm, as no 
longer are there any requirements to travel to school, to spend time reading 
notes on the bus, to look at past year papers and preparing the endless 
questions. Hmm, but new found headaches in planning for trips but those are 
fun fun fun. Asiarooms used to be my first stop as I have used their service 
quite frequently and other than a once mini delay at the check-in at KL, they 
have been rather reliable and will be relying on them once again for my Phuket 
trip tomorrow, *crosses fingers*. However, their Taipei hotels was recently 
revised and their rates seem more expensive now. Or maybe the lousy hotels 
were just crossed out! Alot of the hostels website are interlinked, 
hostelworld etc, and I think I did rely on them last time for Australia and 
they are all also pretty good! Hopefully, can go Europe, America soon =). 

The irritating one would be 
Wired-Destinations (I 
always mis-spell it as Weird, hmm, foreshadowing in progress), they had an unbelievable offer on their 
website which tempted us to go ahead to book, however I went to read up on a 
couple of reviews of their service and it wasn't entirely encouraging, but 
decided to try it still. As the reviews had stated, they were not able to 
fulfill their promised rates and returned with a new rate which was almost 3x 
higher. I guess using cheap rates to advertise isn't a new and that bad a 
thing, but what irritated me was that they had already billed my card and that 
could lead to some potential hassle, but luckily and to their credit, they did 
reply my cancel request very promptly and everything is settled. Just take 
their promotion rates with a pinch of salt. 

Botanical Gardens, mosquito haven. Wow, 
its actually really big. Didn't really had time to walk around and by 
nightfall, it was really sleeping time for the trees with very dim lighting 
and couldn't really see much then. And our National Flower really stinks. The 
other areas don't smell so bad! Looking forward to going there again when I 
have fully recovered and in better conditions. 

4K! Oh, people who haven't watched Spiderman, do yourself a favour and get the 
4K digital tickets, from Golden Village, even if you are NOT a quality freak, 
why shortchange yourself when such a wonderful screening is available, to 
quote - unquote from Mr Brown, *can even see the arm hairs on Mary Jane.* Yup, 
Venom was quite nicely done in the movie, with that swirly tongue and all, 
felt he was a little short though, as compared to the comic Eddie Brock but 
Venom did looked big and menacing, just a bit unlucky in the vertical sense. 
So do yourself and me a favour by getting the 4K tickets, then can brag to me 
how awesome it really is, so I can eagerly await my next big - screen 
experience! 

Kickoff! Beeepp! New (old) vices all around! Am I growing old? In the sense 
that not playing new games but revisiting old ones, erm like Dota, Winning 
Eleven, Curse of Monkey Island, hmm! Gosh, the newest game there is like 2-3 
years old. Haha... what about Command &amp; Conquer 3, recently out! Getting 
quite good reviews, but why no excitement from my part? Hmm. Anyway, old games 
are still classic, and online multiplayer is always fun. (*I have used the 
words old/new a total of 10 times in this paragraph, note to self: GET A 
FREAKING THESAURUS.*) Anyway, back to topic, when's our next kickoff?
