Not surprisingly, I ended up buying a car that wasn't listed in the previous 
entry... (hmm, maybe a very close cousin to one of them). My dad helped me 
source a few parallel importers and we realised that the Honda Fit 2008 model 
was currently for pre-order and would arrive at the end of the year. It was 
selling at the same price as the current Honda Jazz from Kah Motors so what 
the heck, just be a little patient and I can get a newer model. 

Looks wise, I still feel the current Jazz does look abit better especially 
since it comes kitted and does look more aggressive. Sadly, there aren't any 
readily available body kits for the new Fit. Oh well, as time goes by, I'm 
sure there will be more stuff to play around with and kit up the car, so shall 
drive it around as it is first =)

COE is definitely more reassuring, but still equally concerned about the final 
price of it. Seems like the next round COE will be lower, just only hoping 
that it doesn't fall to extreme levels. Last round COE was at 17k.. hmm.. any 
guesses as to what it will be this time around? Shall find out this Wednesday 
=)
