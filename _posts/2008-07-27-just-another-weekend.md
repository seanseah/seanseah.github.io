A common trend nowadays for my 
posts just seems to centralise around a certain something, and that something 
is really that I have lost control of my life. Alot of it stems from me 
wanting to retrieve that **C**ommand and **C**ontrol over my daily routine, 
life etc. I look back in wonders to those University days, having the time to 
exercise, to go to the gym, able to actually read through all my RSS feeds, 
getting satiated on those technological news and what not. It is so different 
as compared to now where I no longer feel control of my time. I often blame 
the lack of time due to work, yet I still spent quite abit of time on 
nonsensical things, to take a break perhaps? Yet.. it still results in time 
wastage. 
Hmm, and on this particular weekend, I will be 
sacrificing some of it to go back to work which could actually make my days 
ahead at work a little more bearable. And to be honest, working on a Sunday is 
way more efficient than normal weekdays where there tend to be a fair bit of 
disruption. Though I have to admit, weekdays' stress level does contribute to 
force me to work / rush things out, though quality of work might be suspect 
=). 

Anyway, this has been a good weekend. Cleared most of my things-to-do list at 
home, and some of it at work. I coughed out some time to exercise, catch up on 
anime, spend quality time with my dear, and oh... managed to catch the Dark 
Knight, which is a very good movie I must add. The movie progressed at a very 
good pace, constantly capturing my attention despite the late screening. Even 
on the 2nd week of screening, it was still packing in the crowds, forcing us 
to once again sit in the first few rows, straining my eyes and necks for the 
movie, but it was worth it. The best thing I like about the movie? The realism 
of it all. It contrasts very much from other Superhero movies as the violence 
is very much believable, and this makes the movie all the more sombre and 
gripping.
