0606 Hrs: Tired, eyes closing yet, struggling to keep them awake to 
prevent myself from over sleeping on the bus journey especially when I still 
have to switch to another bus, and being in the west isn't a very encouraging 
thing =) Decided to blog for the rest of my journey back home to prevent 
myself from sleepign. 

Today has been such an eventful day, with 
first the clearance of soci test. All the mid term tests are over! There's 
technically one more, which is the next Cybercrime test but that is more like 
an exam with it being in the last week of lecture. Soci test was erm, 
interesting, having to crap continuously for an hour and having to squeeze 
them in tiny 6 mm lines, never knew a single mm could matter so much. There 
should be like a big warning to ward people from not leaving spacing for this 
weird foolscap with tiny spacing. 

Following that, had lemonade to drink! 
Sour enough that I didn't feel tired despite feeling quite tired initially 
haha, yet unable to mask the sweetness from the person who made it.

FYP was also looking a bit more cheerful, 
with Kunle saying that I can proceed with my thesis and has somewhat accepted 
my current agreement and its outline. He did ask if I think I had enough 
results, well, I think I have enough for that particular section but I also 
know if I were to put in more effort, given the oodles of time now, I should 
be more than capable of finishing up the extra section. Sigh, I just sound so 
lazy here, and as talking to LH, I really feel quite burnt out over the whole 
FYP thing, perhaps its just inherent in my character to not have ths 
**<u>fighting spirit</u>**. 

I know I was looking at the FYP report 
before the meeting with Kunle and I had no idea what to do with regards to it, 
and just overall felt kinda sick, but in a way, the meeting has re-energized 
me somewhat with the finishing line once again clearer in sight. I guess, the 
final product for Vivian would be to emerge with a published paper? So i 
should just try to help her with that too. 

It was then off to Andy's house for a long 
long night, started with my ahem, technical capabilities with all things 
computer as I led him down the dark side of “higher” definition home 
entertainment. And Claire is such a pretty and extremely adorable girl! She's 
just so cute as she comes up to meet us and play (?) with us. Other than that, 
messing with facial masks, zzz. Kinda uncomfortable and so erm, freaky 
looking. How I got convinced to do something like that is beyond my 
comprehension.

... don't we all just look the same ... 

Oh well, considering how bad my complexion 
is, and how more worse it will get with all these sleepless nights, I really 
need more help in this aspect. And oh... finally soccer! Quite a boring game, 
did like sort of dozed off in the middle but still managed to catch the 
goal... Man Utd been so lucky recently after playing such crap football that I 
am unable to decide if they will continue to ride their luck or otherwise. 

Finally back on Bus 10 @ Harbourfront. I'm going home... freezing on 
the bus, just keeping the laptop on to provide a much needed warmth to the 
hands and legs. Well, never knew that there were so many people taking the bus 
in the morning. Despite the supposed crowd, the bus is still freezing though. 
Gosh, looking at the time now, I will be home at around 7:30 am? Thats still 
quite a long way more, haha, just can't wait to collapse on my bed and pray 
that I don't wake before 12. 

Oh the facial mask picture taken with LH's 
phone cam got me thinking on how useful having a cam phone can be. Despite my 
general pickiness on quality, its not ideal for me to bring my F31 along all 
the time too. Its a small cam yet not being that small to be a portable joy in 
the pockets. Overall the Nokia E65 is such as better deal as compared to the 
E61. Singtel are just keeping the prices up knowing that the lack of camera is 
a strong appeal to the military and certain private area sectors. Zzz. The 
feeling of being commercially exploited is not good. 

Growing up, I don't have the habit of 
keeping photos or taking them until recently. I guess that perhaps only now, I 
realise my memory will not be possible to keep pace with the large track of 
information in my lives as more and more significant events occur. The bus is 
getting crowded. Time for me to take a break =)
