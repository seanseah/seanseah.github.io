From young, had a book by Sumiko Tan which was quite 
interesting and subsequently, I realised that she had a column for straits 
times and followed her weekly articles regularly.. Often she bitched about 
being single, relationships, having kids, and boom.. All of a sudden she's 
already 40+ and still on the same topics that has plagued her for so long.. 
Haha. Her article on yesterday's Strait Times was rather melancholic, on abt 
relationships, on still being single. 
 
Well, just very happy that I 
do have someone to share my life already, my 24 hr 'bestest' friend, my true 
love!
