It has been a very 
interesting year, to say the least. It is only August but suddenly am already 
feeling rather tired, and looking back, indeed many reasons to feel as such. 

The year had first started with a road trip to Melaka, exploring the various 
back alleys and getting to visit the planetarium. And before it seems that we 
could catch our breath, we were off to see the cherry blossoms in Japan. Every 
trip was significant, even the work ones to France and Florida in quick 
succession followed by the impromptu yet grand shanghai proposal. And now, I 
am once again at the airport, albeit the budget one, and waiting for my 
delayed flight to set off. 

This time, the destination is sunny Hanoi. I guess I shall just focus on 
relaxing and not walk around too much, but somehow, a review of my draft 
itinerary shows it to be rather packed already... Zzz. Another 1 and 1/2 hr 
before my flight. Should I even bother visiting the shops inside the budget 
transit area??
