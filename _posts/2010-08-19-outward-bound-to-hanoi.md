It has been a very 
interesting year, to say the least. It is only August but suddenly am already 
feeling rather tired, and looking back, indeed many reasons to feel as such. 

The year had first started with a road trip to Melaka, exploring the various 
back alleys and getting to visit the planetarium. And before it seems that we 
could catch our breath, we were off to see the cherry blossoms in Japan. Every 
trip was significant, even the work ones to France and Florida in quick 
succession followed by the impromptu yet grand shanghai proposal. And now, I 
am once again at the airport, albeit the budget one, and waiting for my 
delayed flight to set off. 

This time, the destination is sunny Hanoi. I guess I shall just focus on relaxing and not walk around too much, but somehow, a review of my draft itinerary shows it to be rather packed already... Zzz. Another 1 and 1/2 hr before my flight. Should I even bother visiting the shops inside the budget transit area?? 
 
Hilariously, the flight was actually delayed. We departed at 2000hrs, when the original schedule was at 1840hrs. We landed at about 10 and I managed to change some money at the airport. The rates were good. It was significantly higher compared to the rate I saw at the Singapore budget terminal but as my story goes, you win some and you lose some. There is really no point in being over calculative. 

What followed was the search for a ride to the hotel. I found the fixed taxi services but it seemed the price had went up by about 50pct as compared to what I had checked online. Deciding that I can afford some risk, I went to check out the private mini buses. Online I had check that the price was about 30000 dong but was first quoted 100k. I bargained till 60k and hopped on and a quick check with the locals next to me revealed that I had been fleeced; it was 30k only. The entire bus was filled with locals, an amazing total of 16 passengers. Anyway 60k wasn't too bad as he did bring me straight to my hotel. I am pretty sure for 30k he was supposed to bring me to the hotel too or I could have just dropped at the first stop in Hanoi city and transferred to a local taxi but it being late at night, I wasn't feeling that brave. The local next to me worked at Vietnam airport and she could speak some English and was immensely helpful in linking up with the driver. As the bus started on its trek towards the city, the night drive exposed me to their rather impatient and chaotic driving skills. Horns and high beams were almost constant as bikes weave in and out of the traffic.

I reached the hotel at close to midnight and the check in process went by smoothly. I felt the room wasn't really up to a 4 room standard but at least it was newly furnished and clean. Anyway took a quick shower and hastily get ready for bed. That sort of concluded my first day in Hanoi.

I got off to a bright and early start the next morning, with a cup of coffee to give that little additional boost. I started the morning hunting for breakfast as I traversed through the streets around my hotel. There were many makeshift stalls with people sitting around on stools tucking in to breakfast. I wasn't ready yet and as I continued my exploration, I chanced upon a place selling pho bo in a small shop and I ordered one bowl for a simple and decent meal. It was rather mediocre actually, with a rather plain broth and overcooked beef. Still, it was my first proper Vietnamese meal.

I began my long walk, heading first past the Hanoi Intl Convention Center and then downwards to Hoan Kiem Lake and continued to their mall Vincom. There was a supermarket there and I managed to get some food and gifts. 

One of the highlight of the trip was engaging a local guide through Hanoikids. I got an insights from a local, and also get to try some unique Hanoi cuisine that I would probably otherwise not have ventured.
