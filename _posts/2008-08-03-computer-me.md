After losing all my files on my harddisk. It took me 
about a couple of hours to set up my computer, install the OS, and that's it, 
feels like I'm back to normal. 

All I need is a web browser and a messenger tool. 

Is that true? 

The other applications serve to make my life easier, like office applications, 
media players etc and are easily replaceable. Hence no big loss that those 
were gone. On a daily basis, most of the information required is retrievable 
off the net and I hardly assess personal files. This whole experience also 
made me realise what are the more important items then...1. Documents 
1. Media 
1. Photos 
1. Eccentric S/W that requires customisation 
1. Obsolete Software w/o Replacement 
With that, really need to 
establish a backup routine, documents due to their size should be synchronised 
online, and while security might be compromised, it allows for access to 
information from anywhere. Hence, just need to be a little careful on what is 
sync-ed to maintain some form of security and it should be good enough. Media 
is a problem, as those tend to take up tons of space, while Picasa and Flickr 
etc offers online storage, there tend to be a limit to how much can be stored 
as well. 

 So unless space and internet 
connection speeds increase a fair bit over the next few years, (which very 
likely it will), I shall stick to the more conservative means of using a spare 
harddisk as a backup... Oh well, shall take it as a good means to start 
afresh...
