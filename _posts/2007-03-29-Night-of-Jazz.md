After a week of bustling with FYP and work, it was a nice reset of pace back to some non-work related stuff. Before that, I managed to submit my thesis / technical paper to both examiner and supervisor and that was like a huge relief when that was done. I guess there are still some details to be improved on, but hopefully, wouldn't be picked on so much!

J was involved in CAC+US 2007. A jazz / pop dance performance.

I had some time so handmade a card for her. I visited her both days actually, but only had the opportunity to watch it on the second day, which was probably a better thing, since it seems like the final performance is usually performed with more heart! So after a hearty dinner, Andy and myself adjourned to the Singapore Conservatory of Music, while waiting the start of the performance.

The show was definitely entertaining, the dances were impressive, songs were alright, except for one group, which was really sort of like a joke. I felt like some of the song segments were kinda just fillers and its existence didn't really matter. But all in, it was still an entertaining way to pass the night.

After the curtains closed, still had to wait for the performers to come out, so slow! Till some parents had to leave first.

To my pal: Andy, thanks! For keeping me company through the show, for waiting with me after it ended, for flowers purchasing in the rain, and for the bukit timah bus ride tales.

To J: Congrats! For putting on such a great performance!
It was a few months of intense training but it all paid off
