Hmm, uploaded these pictures last time as a draft post after the Zoo 
trip but didn't upload it.

Guess what, all the birds here can be 
found in a home at Siglap, well shall just call it the Siglap Bird Park I 
suppose, and no, its not my home although I do have my fair share of feathered 
species. Its a personal property, but with many varieties of birds, and 
different varieties, for example the parrots were like blue, red, yellow, 
green, and very very nice. Don't have their pictures as the place was all 
fenced up sadly and not so nice to take pictures of someone home especially 
with the maid on the balcony looking down.

Ah shucks, can't see much, but there's the 
baby flamingo and some pigeon-peacock lookalike! Anyway, it was an eventful 
day, and just food alone was lots, with tau kwa pao (not tau pok!) katong 
laksa, katong shopping centre cheesecake which ivy intro-ed last time, Bedok's 
Corner 夜来香 cheng teng which is supposedly famous too and now we shall remember 
it for its mind reader stall owner who can predict our purpose in buying cheng 
teng, (for my grandma). And finally a visit to Ken's Noodle House, taking like 
a short foray into a mini Jap Restaurant for authentic ramen, which wasn't too 
bad, and the clientele was largely japanese so that does go quite abit in 
advertising for its authencity. Tiring day!
