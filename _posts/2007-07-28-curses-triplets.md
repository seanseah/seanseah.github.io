The 
Soccer-Ankle Curse.. hmm, us long time cadets  aren't really cut out for much 
physicalities, and the lunchtime soccer sessions have taken its toll on us, 
with me being the latest victim. Oh well, at least I wasn't put of action for 
3 weeks! My ankle was still quite badly bruised, though it wasn't to the 
extent that I can't walk around. Ahh, wasting my precious leave by 
recuperating at home! 

Of the 2nd curse, spent 8 hrs last Saturday 
chiong-ing through the latest Harry Potter book, it was an enjoyable read! 
Only taking some time off to grab some much needed food before continuing 
reading again. Hmm, sometimes reading too fast isn't a good thing though, as 
towards the end, just felt quite tired from the reading and skimmed through a 
few sections and those parts that I didn't really understand were just 
ignored. So well, should take more time to savour the book instead. The ending 
could still have been better though haha... 

And finally, Curse of the Credit Card envy? 
Hmm... always thought I would be in 
control, but hey, all of a sudden, have applied for 4 cards and possibly more 
along the way.. rationale? Well, more cards = more discounts / dining rewards 
/ benefits etc! Don't need the credit limit so well, a debit card would 
suffice. In any case, if this goes on, need to clear my wallet soon! Anyway, 
saw on HWZ that people actually collect credit cards, i.e. sign up and 
terminate.. hmm...
