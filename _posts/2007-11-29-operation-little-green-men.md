The paintball event has been over a month now and the bruises that were left 
behind are long gone but the event is still one of the highlights of my course 
thus far. It was a short 2 match, each lasting probably around 2-4 min but was 
just good fun all around.

First match was just sweet and everything fell in place, running to cover, 
taking down opponents, headshot! the targets and then making the dash for the 
box. 2nd match didnt turned out so good, with 2 out of 5 of us running out of 
ammo and well when that happens, we really just became sitting ducks. Oh 
well.. Lots of adrenalin rushing, and the stings from the pellets were numbed 
somewhat but getting hit from a salvo is still... OUCH. 

Ever since my secondary school days, has been a big fan of first person 
shooting games, especially or to be more specifically, unreal tournament which 
shld be coming up in a future blogpost. So i guess, pain(t)ball is like taking 
the game from behind the desk right to the outdoors and heck it was fun, tho 
strictly limited by our v unfit bodies. Just an initial 20m rundown was 
sufficient for me to be panting heavily.. So perhaps flicking of wrists and 
button clicking is more the sort for me.
