Bad things come in droves. 
Period. Let's have a mini re-cap... my poor old grandma was warded to hospital 
again, suspected due to intestinal virus, resulting in extreme case of 
diarrhoea and fever. But she is getting better as every day passes by so 
that's indeed something to look forward to. Making matters worse, my computer 
harddisk suffered a premature death, hence I am now surfing/using my laptop, 
thank goodness for it. This time around, it is not a software failure and 
rather, the harddisk is just not able to be detected and that means the only 
solution is to send it in. This also only means that I lose all my files on 
the harddisk. The anime / movies / files (!!!) gone is already quite 
disappointing. All the photos, the newer ones are all gone too! I still have 
some backup, but those are still of a year old. All those of recent months are 
now all wiped out! Sheesh... 

Sigh... 

Still so many things to follow 
up and do. Upcoming Friday, will it be a busy Friday at work too? Crossing my 
fingers tightly to not have it such... =)
