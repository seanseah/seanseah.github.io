I just want to find sometime to leave a note here, even 
though I'm so busy at work, though that statement itself can probably be 
subjected to tons of scrutiny by many other colleagues who have toiled much 
harder than me. Normally I would blog about trips and all that but the recent 
bangkok trip will leave it to next time for updates. It was fun though, and 
looking forward to the next getaway from work. A short trip perhaps? 

Anyway, my HP mini note was delayed. Starhub wasn't able 
to fulfill their promise and delayed the collection date till mid august. 
sian... ![](http://bp0.blogger.com/_m5e8Pqc8k3c/SIvlegwZGqI/AAAAAAAAD5w/N_rg4ArJXSM/s1600/mininote.JPG)Kinda maxed out at work recently, 
with so many things happening at once that really, tend to lose focus of what 
to do, and just too tired to do any one thing well. But still, constantly need 
to re-focus on the things to do else will just affect the people around me.
