It's October?description: headline: categories: personaltags:  - reflectionsimagefeature:comments: falsemathjax: nullfeatured: truepublished: true---The last month has been eventful to say the least. After coming back from USA, hardly had time to rest before I was running to and fro again, and the very same day back, had an accident when I dozed off on the roads. Thankfully, it was a mild one, but still slight damage to both cars. Lesson learnt :(Blaming it on the jet lag is one aspect but that was extremely unsafe driving. Thankfully, it didn't result in a more serious catastrophe. Baring a few scratches, my car was generally ok, I suspected it was the same for the other party but claimed against me and that escalated the costs.Work has been a blur since I came back. I do have slightly better control of time, but deadlines come in droves and new things crop up all the time which has resulted in me being super stretched out. But to a certain extent, that's all over and done with, some events went well, some didn't, but all in all, I would say that this year has turned out quite well. I still suck at handling HR issues though.. and that is always a concern and challenge to understand them. It is an art that I'm painfully trying every day.Wake me up when November ends!
