I have started travelling from a young age, as my dad used to bring me on annual trips and I guess that had build up my confidence and spark the interest for my subsequent travels. 

As a kid, I was fortunate enough to have visit America, London, Thailand, Australia, Korea and more. The crossover point would be when I first travelled with my friend to Australia after our first year in University. These trips had occurred at different stages in my life and I intend to record these journeys and also to capture some of the emotions and I feelings I had during those instances. I am looking forward to visit more parts of the world and perhaps, one day, even beyond as we may finally be able to a little 'star wars' exploration. A man is allowed to dream right?

My first solo trip out was a visit to Sydney and Melbourne back in June/July of 2004. I travelled with Nicholas, a secondary school friend as we were both on school holidays.

It was my first university holidays and I was contemplating whether I should get a part time job during that period but decided against it as I was much more keen to explore the world. I still recalled I only had one carry on bag with me and that was surprisingly able to last me the full 15 days. Gosh, I must have smelled rather badly by the end of the trip. The trip was long and we took quite a few day tours to explore the various scenic places near the two cities. I didn't had a digital camera during that time and while not much photos were taken and neither did I journal down the entries, but looking back, there were still many amazing memories. Some of it was visiting the Penguin Parade in Melbourne, shivering in the dark as we waited for the penguins to show up, road trips out to the various wine vineyards and the ensuing wine tasting sessions, getting lost in Sydney city and having to trek back through the cold in the empty and poorly lit park. We also stayed in the famed red light district of Sydney and getting cheated at one of the strip joints, the overnight train from Sydney to Melbourne, trying my luck at the casinos in Melbourne and watching the Euro 2004 finals with the local crowds. I guess travelling is not just about the places that we have seen, though they were awesome and plentiful (Sydney Opera House, Blue Mountain and may many more), the fun also was about the experiences shared.


### KL / Genting

With my JC friends having completed their National Service stint and with the freedom to travel during the school holidays, we embarked on a bus trip up towards Genting Highlands with a mid way stop at KL. More negative memories on the trip than positive actually. The theme park was rather unmemorable and we were also rather unsuccessful at the Casino, resulting in us being bored most of the time. We even tried watching a movie there, but our choice of show was terrible with an extremely ridiculous and boring movie, was it Ultraviolet? We spent quite a fair bit of time just relaxing and chilling out at the various Starbucks but at least the company wasn't too bad.

### Krabi Bangkok

This trip was great and yet, wrong for so many reasons. I had tried rock climbing before but not extensively and defnitely not on a regular basis. When invited to go on a rock climbing trip, I decided to just go ahead. It was fantastic and a decision that I never regretted. The great thing was that we went with experienced people, both at rock climbing and navigating in and around Krabi. Thanks to them, we were able to visit the more unique locations. The interesting and varied climbs, the thrills and exhilaration when making it to the top of the cliff, tipping over in a kayak, the night chill out sessions by the beach and trekking through the jungles and sea cliffs even at night. It was really as simple as waking up, heading out to the different places to climb, and in the afternnon, as we got bored, we would just relax at the beach. It was a very laid back holiday but a great way to pass time. I am actually thinking whether I should go on a diving trip next as it does sound quite similar. Or should I embark on another rock climbing trip again?
