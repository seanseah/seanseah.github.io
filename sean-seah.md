I
love
technology.

*All sorts. Gadgets. Phones. Computers. Wearables.*

Back in 2012, together with Zhaolin, we launched GadgetReactor to capture our thoughts and opinions on the latest technology, especially on the Singapore front. There are many, many noteworthy international tech blogs, but local ones weren't that many. GadgetReactor soon evolved to cover gadgets in all forms, and especially interested in tech that serve to improve life. It was fun. Blogging has brought me new opportunities and allowed me to experience the latest gadgets first hand. Along the way, I noticed that certain technology have stagnated, and companies come and go. The death of Nokia is one such example. The lesson from it applies to us as well. We need to stay relevant otherwise we become obsolete.

On a personal level, I started my own blog back in 2007. I thought this could be quite fun, always wanted to blog but never had much of a life to talk about, and this could be somewhat of an outlet for people to get to know more about me. The coolest thing would be I suppose, the retrospective this allows. I wonder how it will all look when I take this trip down memory lane in a few years time, as I seek to discover the memories and moments that pass us by.
