I
love
technology.

*All sorts. Gadgets. Phones. Computers. Wearables.*

Back in 2012, together with Zhaolin, we started GadgetReactor to capture our 
thoughts and opinions on the latest technology, especially on the Singapore front. 
There are many, many noteworthy international tech blogs, but local ones weren't 
that many. GadgetReactor soon evolved to cover gadgets in all forms. It was fun. 
Blogging brought me new opportunities and allowed me to experience the latest 
gadgets first hand. Yu Cheng joined the team in 2016, and added an insightful 
perspective especially on mobile technology. 

Along the way, I noticed that the cruel sword of obsolescence spares none,
with many companies falling. The downfall of Nokia is one such example. The lesson 
from it applies to us as well. We need to stay relevant otherwise we become obsolete.
Tech blogs are no exception, and the relevancy of the articles are extremely short-
lived. Interest in specific tech content do not last more than a few months.

On a personal level, I started my own blog back in 2007. I thought this could be quite 
fun, always wanted to blog but never had much of a life to talk about, and this could 
be somewhat of an outlet for people to get to know more about me. The coolest thing would 
be I suppose, the retrospective this allows. I wonder how it will all look when I take this 
trip down memory lane in a few years time, as I seek to discover the memories and moments 
that pass us by.

Life is never an easy path to move forward on. There are setbacks and challenges, but it is
how we respond to them that defines us. _Learn from [past experiences](/life-big-moments/), 
but live life with no regrets_.
